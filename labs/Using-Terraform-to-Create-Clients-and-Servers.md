# [Using Terraform to Create Clients and Servers](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2783)

In this lab, you will provision a Linux virtual machine in a private network to act as a database server. You will also create a virtual machine that you can use as a bastion host to connect to the database server as an administrator. You will configure the database server for remote connections and add a user account. You will then install the MySQL client software to connect to the database server from a client machine.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Create client and server VMs

## Step 4: Task 2. Administer your database server

## Step 5: Task 3. Connect to the database from a client
