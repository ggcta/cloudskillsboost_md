# [Analyzing Movie Posters in BigQuery with Remote Models](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/31374)

In this lab, you learn how to use BigQuery Machine Learning for inference with remote models (Gemini AI models) to Analyze Movie Posters. BigQuery Machine Learning for inference lets you create and run machine learning (ML) models by using GoogleSQL queries. 

## Step 1: GSP1247

## Step 2: Overview

## Step 3: Objectives

## Step 4: Setup and requirements

## Step 5: Task 1. Configure your environment and project to use APIs

## Step 6: Task 2. Create a Cloud Resource connection

## Step 7: Task 3. Grant IAM permissions to the connection's service account

## Step 8: Task 4. Create the dataset and object table in BigQuery for movie poster images

## Step 9: Task 5. Create the Gemini remote models in BigQuery

## Step 10: Task 6. Prompt Gemini to provide movie summaries for each poster

## Step 11: Task 7. Generate text embeddings using a remote model

## Step 12: Congratulations!
