# [Deploy a BigQuery ML Customer Churn Classifier to Vertex AI for Online Predictions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/3966)

In this lab, you will train, tune, evaluate, explain, and generate batch and online predictions with a BigQuery ML XGBoost model. You will use a Google Analytics 4 dataset from a real mobile application, Flood it!, to determine the likelihood of users returning to the application. You will generate batch predictions with your BigQuery ML model as well as export and deploy it to Vertex AI for online predictions.
