# [Serverless Data Processing with Dataflow - Using Dataflow SQL for Streaming Analytics (Java)](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/3100)

In this lab you read data from a streaming source, perform the same aggregations you performed before but this time in SQL, and write out results in a streaming fashion to BigQuery. You will also create a Dataflow SQL Streaming job from the BigQuery UI.
