# [Training and Deploying a TensorFlow Model in Vertex AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/6156)

In this lab, you will use BigQuery for data processing and exploratory data analysis, and the Vertex AI platform to train and deploy a custom TensorFlow Regressor model to predict customer lifetime value (CLV). The goal of the lab is to introduce to Vertex AI through a high value real world use case - predictive CLV. Starting with a local BigQuery and TensorFlow workflow, you will progress toward training and deploying your model in the cloud with Vertex AI.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup

## Step 3: Task 1. Enable Google Cloud services

## Step 4: Task 2. Create Vertex AI custom service account for Vertex Tensorboard integration

## Step 5: Task 3. Launch Vertex AI Workbench notebook

## Step 6: Task 4. Clone the lab repository

## Step 7: Task 5. Install lab dependencies and Run the Notebook

## Step 8: Congratulations!

## Step 9: End your lab
