# [Optimizing Performance of LookML Queries](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/4170)

In this lab, you learn how to optimize query performance in Looker.

## Step 1: GSP985

## Step 2: Overview

## Step 3: Setup and requirements

## Step 4: Key recommendations for optimizing query performance

## Step 5: Task 1. Create an incremental persistent derived table that will auto-update without rebuilding the entire table

## Step 6: Task 2. Create an incremental aggregate table to summarize order data across multiple time periods

## Step 7: Task 3. Join views in a performant manner to optimize Explore queries

## Step 8: Task 4. Monitor the builds of persistent derived tables in a Looker instance

## Step 9: Congratulations!
