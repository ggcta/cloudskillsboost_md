# [Serverless Data Processing with Dataflow - Using Dataflow for Streaming Analytics (Java)](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/3026)

In this lab you read data from a streaming source, perform the same aggregations you performed before, and write out results in a streaming fashion to BigQuery. You will also experiment with the difference in processing time and event time with lagging (late) data.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Task 1. Reading from a streaming source

## Step 3: Task 2. Window the data

## Step 4: Task 3. Aggregate the data

## Step 5: Task 4. Write to BigQuery

## Step 6: Task 5. Run your pipeline

## Step 7: Task 6. Generate lag-less streaming input

## Step 8: Task 7. Introduce lag to streaming input

## Step 9: End your lab
