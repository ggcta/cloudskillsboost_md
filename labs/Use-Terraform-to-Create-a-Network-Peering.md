# [Use Terraform to Create a Network Peering](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2782)

In this lab, you will peer two networks. This will allow communication between machines in those networks using internal IP addresses. This means databases can be deployed on a private network without external IP addresses, and those database will only be reachable from from the peered network.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Peer two networks

## Step 4: Task 2. Deploy a VM with no external IP

## Step 5: End your lab
