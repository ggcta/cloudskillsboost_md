# [Migrating On-premises MySQL Using a Continuous Database Migration Service Job](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/31281)

In this lab, you migrate an on-premises MySQL database (running on a virtual machine) to Cloud SQL for MySQL using a continuous Database Migration Service job and VPC peering for connectivity. After you create and run the migration job, you confirm that an initial copy of your database has been successfully migrated to your Cloud SQL for MySQL instance. Then, you explore how continuous migration jobs continue to apply data updates from your source database to your Cloud SQL instance until you choose to complete the job. To conclude the migration job, you promote the Cloud SQL instance to be a new standalone database for reading and writing data.

## Step 1: GSP860

## Step 2: Overview

## Step 3: Setup and requirements

## Step 4: Task 1. Get the connectivity information for the MySQL source instance

## Step 5: Task 2. Create a new connection profile for the MySQL source instance

## Step 6: Task 3. Create and start a continuous migration job

## Step 7: Task 4. Review the status of the continuous migration job

## Step 8: Task 5. Confirm the data in Cloud SQL for MySQL

## Step 9: Task 6. Test the continuous migration of data from the source to the destination instance

## Step 10: Task 7. Promote Cloud SQL to be a standalone instance for reading and writing data

## Step 11: Congratulations!
