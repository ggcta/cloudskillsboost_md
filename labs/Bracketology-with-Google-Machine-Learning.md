## Step 3: Setup and requirements

## Step 4: Task 1. Open the BigQuery console

## Step 5: Task 2. NCAA March Madness

## Step 6: Task 3. Find the NCAA public dataset in BigQuery

## Step 7: Task 4. Write a query to determine available seasons and games

## Step 8: Task 5. Understand machine learning features and labels

## Step 9: Task 6. Create a labeled machine learning dataset

## Step 10: Task 7. Create a machine learning model to predict the winner based on seed and team name

## Step 11: Task 8. Evaluate model performance

## Step 12: Task 9. Making predictions

## Step 13: Task 10. How many did our model get right for the 2018 NCAA tournament?

## Step 14: Task 11. Models can only take you so far...
