# [Building Realtime Pipelines in Cloud Data Fusion](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2732)

In addition to batch pipelines, Data Fusion also allows you to create realtime pipelines, that can process events as they are generated. Currently, realtime pipelines execute using Apache Spark Streaming on Cloud Dataproc clusters. In this lab you you will learn how to build a streaming pipeline using Data Fusion.

## Step 8: Task 5. Add a Pub/Sub subscription

## Step 9: Task 6. Add necessary permissions for your Cloud Data Fusion instance

## Step 10: Task 7. Navigate the Cloud Data Fusion UI

## Step 11: Task 8. Build a realtime pipeline

## Step 12: Task 9. Send messages into Cloud Pub/Sub

## Step 13: Task 10. Viewing your pipeline metrics

## Step 14: Congratulations!
