# [Introducing the Keras Sequential API on Vertex AI Platform](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2675)

In this lab, you will see how to build a simple deep neural network model using the Keras Sequential API and Feature Columns. Once you have trained your model, you will deploy it using AI Platform and see how to call the model for online prediciton.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Launch Vertex AI Workbench instance

## Step 4: Task 2. Clone a course repo within your JupyterLab interface

## Step 5: Task 3. Keras Sequential API

## Step 6: End your lab
