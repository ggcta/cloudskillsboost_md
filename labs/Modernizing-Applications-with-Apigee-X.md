# [Modernizing Applications with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/4439)

In this lab, you deploy a backend service on Cloud Run. The backend service implements a REST API for a bank, storing customers, accounts, ATMs, and transactions in a Firestore database. You create a shared flow that retrieves and caches content from an external service. You then call that shared flow from your API proxy, and use JavaScript code to modify an API response.
