# [Advanced Visualizations with TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/4019)

This lab illustrates how TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) can be used to investigate and visualize your dataset. That includes looking at descriptive statistics, inferring a schema, checking for and fixing anomalies, and checking for drift and skew in our dataset. It is important to understand your datasets characteristics, including how it might change over time in your production pipeline. It is also important to look for anomalies in your data, and to compare your training, evaluation, and serving datasets to make sure that they are consistent.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Set up your lab environment

## Step 3: Task 1. Launch Vertex AI Workbench instance

## Step 4: Task 2. Clone a course repo within your JupyterLab interface

## Step 5: Task 3. Create advanced visualizations with TensorFlow Data Validation

## Step 6: End your lab
