# [Implementing a Hub and Spoke using NCC](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/31620)

In this lab, you create a hub and spoke topology using NCC. In this hands-on exercise, you'll design and implement a classic hub-and-spoke network topology. Your pre-configured environment includes three VPC networksâ€”a central hub and two branches (spoke1 and spoke2).

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Explore the pre-configured network

## Step 4: Task 2. Create a VM in each VPC

## Step 5: Task 3: Test connectivity

## Step 6: Task 4: Create a hub and spoke using NCC

## Step 7: Task 5. Retest connectivity

## Step 8: Task 6. Explore the Network Topology Tool

## Step 9: Congratulations!

## Step 10: End your lab
