# [Creating SQL Server Databases on Compute Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2779)

In this lab, you will provision a SQL Server machine in a private network. Then, you will create a Windows machine in a public network that you can use to adminstrate the database server. You will also create a Linux client in the public network that can be used to connect to the database. Lastly, you will setup a firewall rule that allows access to the SQL Server database only from the private network.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Create client and server VMs

## Step 4: Task 2. Administer your database server

## Step 5: Task 3. Connect to the database from a client

## Step 6: End your lab
