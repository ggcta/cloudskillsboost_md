# [TPU Speed Data Pipelines](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/4793)

TPUs are very fast. The stream of training data must keep up with their training speed. In this lab, you will learn how to load data from GCS with the tf.data.Dataset API to feed your TPU.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Launch Vertex AI Notebooks

## Step 4: Task 2. Clone course repo within your Vertex AI Notebooks instance

## Step 5: Task 3. TPU-Speed Data Pipelines: tf.data.Dataset and TFRecords

## Step 6: End your lab
