# [Administering a Highly Available Cloud SQL for SQL Server Database](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/2776)

In this lab, you will create a SQL Server database using Google Cloud SQL. You will enable high availability and deploy it securely with only a private IP address. You will then load a sample database into it and connect to the database using a client machine. You will also perform backup and restore operations and test high availability by triggering a failover.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup and requirements

## Step 3: Task 1. Create a secure, highly available SQL Server database using Cloud SQL

## Step 4: Task 2. Perform backup and restore operations

## Step 5: Task 3. Connect to the database using its private IP address

## Step 6: Task 4. Trigger a failover to test high availability

## Step 7: Congratulations!

## Step 8: End your lab
