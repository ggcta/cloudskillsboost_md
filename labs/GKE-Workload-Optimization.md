# [GKE Workload Optimization](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/3312)

This lab demonstrates how optimization in your cluster's workloads can lead to an overall optimization of your resources and costs. It walks through a few different workload optimization strategies such as container native load balancing, application load testing, readiness and liveness probes, and pod disruption budgets.

## Step 1: GSP769

## Step 2: Overview

## Step 3: Objectives

## Step 4: Setup and requirements

## Step 5: Task 1. Container-native load balancing through ingress

## Step 6: Task 2. Load testing an application

## Step 7: Task 3. Readiness and liveness probes

## Step 8: Task 4. Pod disruption budgets

## Step 9: Congratulations!
