# [Distributed Training with Keras](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/4018)

The tf.distribute.Strategy API provides an abstraction for distributing your training across multiple processing units. The goal is to allow users to enable distributed training using existing models and training code, with minimal changes.

## Step 1: Overview

## Step 2: Setup

## Step 3: Task 1. Launch Vertex AI Workbench instance

## Step 4: Task 2. Clone a course repo within your JupyterLab interface

## Step 5: Task 3. Distributed training with Keras

## Step 6: End your lab
