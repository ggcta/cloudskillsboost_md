# [Public Sector Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/110)

The Public Sector learning path covers three key topics:Data, Security, and AI/ML in the context of public sector utilization of Google Cloud. The courses in this path pair public sector-specific coverage of a topic, such as sharing data with Dataplex and Analytics Hub, with recommendations for courses that go deeper into those topics. Learners will gain a broad understanding of data, how to apply AI/ML principles to data, and the basics of using security tool sets on Google Cloud.
