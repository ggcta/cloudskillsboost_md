# [Deploy and Manage Generative AI Models](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/1283)

This learning path provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning operations (MLOps), with a specific focus on generative AI. Youâ€™ll learn to manage the entire lifecycle of generative AI models, from development and deployment to monitoring. Test your knowledge with a hands-on lab where you'll train and deploy a model in the cloud with Vertex AI.
