# [Generate Smarter Generative AI Outputs](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/1284)

This learning path is for developers who want to build applications with generative AI. Learn how to develop an AI project on Google Cloud, use diffusion models for image generation, and build a search application with Vector Search and embeddings. Then, dive deeper into multimodal prompts and multimodal RAG with Gemini to generate text and visual data.
