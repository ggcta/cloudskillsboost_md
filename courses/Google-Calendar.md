person: Hello, and welcome. In this course, you'll be introduced to Google Calendar, Google's scheduling service that's part of Google workspace. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations and hands on activities, we hope that you'll become more confident using Google Calendar. With Google Calendar, you can quickly schedule meetings and events and get reminders about upcoming activities, so you always know what's next. Google Calendar is designed for teams, so it's easy to share your schedule with others and create multiple calendars that you and your team can use together. We encourage you to be signed into Google Workspace throughout the course, not just for the activities. You can pause the video lecture or demonstration at any time and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer On The Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you will use Google Calendar to solve a particular business challenge being faced by On The Rise. So let's take a look at the scenario we'll be using as you learn some key features of Google Calendar. Over the last three decades, On The Rise partner owners Thomas Omar and Saroja Malone have seen their company grow from a small family business to a global bakery chain. The days of casual on site family meetings are gone, replaced by those of a formal leadership team operating from many countries around the world. Each member of the team is full of great ideas and has the experience and expertise to implement them. Yet, with so many differing individual priorities, Thomas wants to make sure he can narrow the projects down to the critical few and keep his team productive and focused on the bakery's overall strategic objectives. Thomas asks for your help. He wants to set up recurring leadership team meetings using Google Calendar. He also wants to create a common calendar so he and other team members can track key dates for strategic On The Rise projects. Okay, ready to get started? Great. Let's begin.

Welcome to Module 1, Introduction to Google Calendar. Google Calendar enables you to easily schedule meetings and events, create tasks, and collaborate on shared calendars, so you always know what's next. In this module, you'll learn how to open and navigate Google Calendar. Google Calendar helps you stay organized with its simple yet powerful web based service. Use Google Calendar to schedule a meeting, invite guests, create a task, and ensure that you are always where you need to be. You can also share your calendar and review your colleagues' calendars to avoid scheduling conflicts. There are a few ways to access Google Calendar. Open your browser and visit calendar.google.com. Or if you're already logged into Google Workspace, select the apps launcher, and then the Google Calendar icon to open it in a new browser tab. You can also download the Google Calendar app for your mobile device from the Google Play Store for Android or the Apple App Store for iPhones and iPads. If you haven't done so already, open your Google Calendar now. Google Calendar's intuitive layout ensures that you can easily see your upcoming events, view multiple calendars at once, and quickly create new events. You can also create tasks in Google Calendar, explore integrations with other Google Workspace apps, and subscribe to useful calendars that go beyond events and appointments. We'll start with navigating the Google Calendar web interface.

person: The Google Calendar Main Menu occupies the left side of the window. Select the Main Menu icon to collapse and expand it. The Create button opens an event creation window with the current time and date. Add a title, set a date and time, and select Save to quickly add an event. We'll cover creating events in more detail shortly. Directly below the Create button is the mini calendar. Use the mini calendar to quickly select a month and date to view on your calendar. Today's date will be highlighted by a blue circle on the mini calendar. To quickly create an event with guests, use the Search for People box to type the name or email address of people to invite and press Enter to open an events detail window. There are two lists of calendars, My Calendars and Other Calendars. The My Calendars list contains your primary calendar and calendars you create. It will also contain any calendars that have been shared with you if you've been given permission to make changes and manage sharing for that calendar, Your primary calendar is your default calendar, where you will create your events, and it's also the calendar that displays events you've been invited to. The Other Calendars list contains calendars that you may have subscribed to, or calendars have been shared with you and you do not own. This may be colleagues' calendars, holiday calendars, sports calendars, and public calendars on the Internet. Along the top of the Google Calendar window, the Today button will return you to the current date view of your calendar from wherever you're viewing in the past or future. The arrows will move you to the previous or next week view of your calendar. Select Search to find events by keywords, participants, or organizers, locations or rooms, or date range. The support button has links to documentation and training on Google Calendar. The Settings menu button has links to Google Calendar settings, trash for deleted events, density and color options, and print preview. Your organization may also allow the installation of Google Calendar add-ons, which give it additional features and capabilities. Explore the add-ons in the Google Workspace Marketplace by selecting Get Add-ons. Select View to switch views of your calendar. The button will display the name of the view that is currently selected. By default, it will be the week view, but you can easily switch to day, month, year, schedule, and custom day range views. There are also options to display weekends and declined events. Both of these are enabled by default.

## Manage Google Calendar

Google Calendar makes it easy to set up events and share information. In this module we'll explore how to schedule events, add video conferencing with Google Meet, attach documents from Google Drive, and set visibility and notifications.

### Video - [Manage Google Calendar](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528402)

Welcome to Module 2, Manage Google Calendar. Google Calendar makes it easy to set up events and share information. In this module, we'll explore how to schedule events, add video conferencing with Google Meet, attach documents from Google Drive, and set visibility and notifications. You can create a new event within Google Calendar by either selecting Create, or by selecting an empty time slot on the calendar grid. In the event window, select Add Title and type a title for your event. In addition to events, you can add out of office times, tasks, and appointment schedules. We'll cover those in more detail later in the course. The next step is to select a date, start time, and an end time. If your event covers multiple days, select the date the event ends. Events that encompass one or more full days will appear at the top of the calendar grid. Optionally, you can add a location for the meeting. Google Calendar will suggest nearby locations when you type an address. Your guests that use Google Calendar can view the event details and select the location to open it in Google Maps. Select More Options to see and modify additional event details or select Save to add the event to your calendar. In the Event Details window, select All Day to make your events start at 12:00 a.m. on the start date, and end at 11:59 p.m. on the end date. Again, all-day events appear at the top of the calendar grid for the days they are scheduled. Events can occur just once or they can be scheduled to repeat. Google Calendar has options to repeat an event daily, weekly, monthly, annually, and on every weekday. If none of those options is appropriate, choose Custom Recurrence and set the recurrence properties you require. For example, you might want to create a project review meeting that occurs Monday and Thursday of each week for 12 weeks only. In this example, you would choose a custom recurrence because this allows you to choose an end date for the meeting either by choosing a date or by specifying a number of occurrences.

Now it's your turn. In this activity, you will create a calendar event and then modify it.

person: You can add one or more people as guests by typing their name into the Add Guests field. Google Calendar will suggest guests from your organization and personal contacts. Select them from the list as you type. To invite a guest who is outside your organization and not in your personal contacts, type their email address. After a guest has been added, select Mark as Optional if their presence is requested but not required. By default, guests cannot modify event details, but can invite other guests and see the guest list. Select the guest permissions options that are appropriate for your event. You can also change your default guest permissions on your own calendar settings page. If your organization uses Google Groups, you can use the group email address to invite many guests at once. If you have a minimum of see only free or busy access to your guest calendars, you'll be able to select suggested times to see upcoming time slots that all of your guests have open on their calendar. Keep in mind, the open calendar time doesn't always equal free time or guaranteed availability for guests. You can also select Find a Time to view your calendar alongside your guest calendar to more easily schedule an event during times when you're all available. You can also filter this view based on day or week, guests and rooms. Rooms are resource calendars centrally managed by the organization, created to book a physical location like a conference or meeting room. Resources can also represent a physical object, like a shared cart of Chromebooks, projectors, or vehicles like delivery trucks or company cars; literally anything that is shared among a group, department, or building. If your organization has created resource calendars, select Rooms to search or see available rooms. Then select from the list of available rooms to add a room to your event. Remember, that booking a resource may require approval from the resource calendar manager. Google Calendar can smartly integrate resources when events are created. Based on your work location, which is drawn from your Google directory listing, calendar will show the best rooms closest to the invited guests. The suggestions use information like the guest's office building, floor, previous bookings, meeting room capacity, and equipment to ensure that the optimal room is booked for the event. Now, have you ever tried to book a room in another system only to find it was already booked? But then you notice that the room isn't actually being used at all? Well, if you have, you may be pleased to know that Google Workspace supports automatic room release. This feature frees up booked rooms when they're no longer needed, such as when two out of three guests for a meeting decline the invitation. Any meeting that has only one participant will also trigger the room release. Adding a guest to an event automatically adds a Google Meet video meeting link. Select the down arrow to see the Google Meet details. Guests will be able to select Join with Google Meet in the event details to join the meeting, and it will appear on the Google Meet page at meet.google.com on the day of the event. Select Remove Conference to eliminate the Google Meet video meeting from the event. Depending on your own organizational policies, the Google Meet details may also include a phone number and PIN for dial in access. Google Meet is covered in more detail in another course. To help your guests prepare for the event, add a detailed description. The description can include links to resources or information on the web. Files can also be added by uploading them from your device or adding them from Google Drive. Typically, you might want to attach a meeting agenda or some required reading for your guests. When you attach a file from Google Drive and select Save, Google Calendar will prompt you to share the files you attach with the guests. You can give guests view, comment, or edit permission.

### Video - [Event visibility and notifications](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528408)

- [YouTube: Event visibility and notifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRUz4tJIfY)

person: While you have visibility at the calendar level, you can also set visibility at the event level. Your primary calendar's event visibility is default visibility and is determined by your organization's policies for Google Calendar. If your calendar isn't shared with anyone specifically, changing the event visibility won't enable anyone to see the event details. However, if you've shared your calendar with specific people, they'll be able to see the event details based on the level of access you've assigned them. By setting the event visibility to private for a specific event, you can override the calendar-level visibility. Perhaps you have a personal meeting out of the office and, although you want the event to appear on your calendar, you don't want to share the details of the event with everyone who can see your calendar. You can choose to make an event private, and the event will only show as "busy" on your calendar, unless the person you have shared your calendar with has been given permission to see and change all event details. You can also add notifications to ensure that you won't miss an important event. Notifications, by default, will appear in the Google Calendar window and as a pop-up or toast on your desktop. The notification will appear ten minutes before the start time of the event. If you prefer, you can change the notification settings to send you an email instead, and you can add multiple notifications for a single event. Remember, the notifications you set on an event are for you only. The organizer and each attendee can set their own notifications. When you finish configuring your event, select Save to add it to the calendar. If your event has guests, you can choose whether to send them an email invitation. Guests who don't use Google Calendar will always get an email notification. Guests who use Google Calendar may have notifications disabled for their calendar and won't get an invitation email even if you choose to send one, but the event will still be added to their calendar. To discard an event before saving it for the first time, select Cancel Event Creation in the upper-left window of the Event Details window. Depending on your organization's Google Calendar policies, you might also get a warning if you are inviting a guest who is not in your Google Workspace domain.

## Respond to and manage events

With Google Calendar, you can easily reply to event invitations and manage the events that you create. This module explores how the features of Google Calendar allow you to update events, check guest attendance, delete and restore events, and search Google Calendar.

### Video - [Respond to and manage events](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528410)

person: Welcome to Module 3: Respond to and manage events. With Google Calendar, you can easily reply to event invitations and manage the events that you create. This module explores how the features of Google Calendar allow you to update events, check guest attendance, delete and restore events, and search Google Calendar. If you're added as a guest to an event in Google Calendar, the proposed event will appear on your calendar grid. Select the event to view its details. In the going section, select yes, no, or maybe to respond to to the event organizer. You might also receive an email invitation. The response options will appear at the top of the email. After you've chosen the response, you can open the event on your calendar and change it at any time before the event. You can also opt to propose a new time and send the proposed time with an optional message to the organizer. The organizer can review proposals and either choose or reject them. You can also send a note to the organizer by selecting add note. If the event has a large number of guests, the ability to propose new time might not be available. If the organizer permits guests to add additional guests, you can forward an email notification for an event to another person. If they accept the invitation, they'll appear in the guest list for the event. You can also add a guest from the event details on your calendar. Sometimes as the organizer of an event, you will want to make changes. To update the event, select it on your calendar grid and select edit event. Then, after you've made the changes, select save. You can choose to send an update email to guests to alert them to the changes. However, if you modify an event that has already passed, no updates will be sent. Attendees can also update an event. If the attendee has modify access to the event, changes will be reflected on everyone's calendar. Otherwise, the changes will only be visible on their own calendar. To check who has sent a response to your event, select the event on your calendar grid. The number of guests and their status will be listed. As guests respond, their contact icon will display a green check for yes, a red X for no and a gray question mark for maybe. Guests can change their response multiple times before the event. So check back often to get an updated status on your guest list To delete an event, select the event in your calendar grid. Select delete to remove it from your calendar and the calendars of your guests. You can also right-click an event to delete it, change the event color, or join its Google Me video meeting. If you're the organizer of the event, you'll be prompted to send an event cancelation email to all attendees. If you are a guest for the event, deleting it from your calendar is the same as declining the event. The organizer will see that you're no longer attending. When you delete a recurring event, Google Calendar will prompt you to select whether you want to delete just a selected instance of the event, the event and all the future occurrences of it, or all the events in the series. Some other calendar systems allow events to be canceled, but they remain on the organizer's calendar. Events canceled in Google Calendar are deleted from all calendars. What happens if you want to undelete an event? Well, as in Gmail and Google Drive, Google Calendar events that are deleted are moved to trash. To access the trash, select the settings menu and then select trash from the menu. Choose the select item box next to the event and select restore all selected to send the event back to your calendar. Alternatively, select delete forever all selected to purge the event immediately. Selecting empty trash will purge all the events in the trash. Did you know that all Google workspace apps use intelligent search in order to help you find exactly what you're looking for? Type a person's name, a key word, or phrase in the search box, and Google will suggest results from Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive and the Web. Select a result to view the details for an event. To narrow your search, select the down arrow to view the search fields which, what, who, where, doesn't have, and date range.

## Other event types

Google Calendar offers multiple ways to help you enhance your productivity and communicate about scheduling more effectively. In this module we'll cover how to use other event types and features, including out of office, tasks, and appointment schedules.

### Video - [Other event types](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528414)

Welcome to Module 4, Other event types. Google Calendar offers multiple ways to help you enhance your productivity and communicate about scheduling more effectively. In this module, we'll cover how to use other event types and features, including out of office, tasks, and appointment schedules. You may have used the out of office auto reply in Gmail to alert senders that you're not available. Google Calendar has a similar feature: Out of office. You can set Out of office times for either part or all of the day or even multiple days. To set Out of office for a day in the top of the grid, select the day you'll be away, then select Out of office. By default, new and existing meetings during the Out of office time you set will automatically be declined, although you can choose not to. You can also customize the default message that is sent when the meeting is declined. Note that this functionality does not apply to personal accounts. Alternatively, you can select and drag on the calendar grid when in Month view to set a time for Out of office. When you stop dragging at the end of the timeframe, the event details window will appear, so you can modify the details of the event, in this case Out of office. When you create an event on Google Calendar, you can also opt to make it a task. Select any empty space on the calendar grid and choose Task from the event types. Give it a title. Set a date and time, or choose All day. Optionally, add a description. Select a task list to add it to and then select Save. Tasks appear every day at the specified time until you mark them as done or delete them. Tasks are also available in the side panel in Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, or Slides. To view tasks in your calendar, the box next to Tasks in your My calendars list must be checked. Appointment schedules are special blocks in your calendar that people can use to reserve time with you. For example, as an HR professional, you could set up office hours when employees are able to book a 15-minute slot to speak with you about benefits. To create a block of time for an appointment schedule, select the calendar grid while in the Day or Week views. Select Appointment schedule from the event details window and give the event a title. Choose a time frame for the appointments, and then select a time slot length in minutes. If you choose a time slot duration of 30 minutes, and the appointment schedule block was two hours, four slots will be created. Unlike normal events, you don't invite potential guests. The appointment schedule will have a special booking page that you can share with potential guests. Guests can select a slot from the event, and then once a slot is selected, it's removed from the block as an option. Note that to access the booking page, guests must be signed into a Google account.

- [YouTube: Activity 4 explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psf5_V_ubX0)

Now it's your turn. In this activity, you will apply some other event types using Google Calendar. You will set an out of office response for next week, then create a task for the day you return to the office.

## Sharing calendars

Google Calendar is designed for collaboration. This module explores how to share your schedule with others and create and manage multiple calendars that you and your team can use together.

### Video - [Sharing calendars](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528418)

- [YouTube: Sharing calendars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cscaUgyckdQ)

person: Welcome to module five, sharing calendars. Google Calendar is designed for collaboration. This module explores how to share your schedule with others and create and manage multiple calendars that you and your team can use together. Google Calendar makes it easy for coworkers to schedule time with you. There are two ways to share your calendar. You can share broadly with users across your organization, and you can share with specific people. You choose who to share with from your calendar settings page in the Access permissions, and Share with specific people settings. For example, you might want to share free or busy time with everyone in your organization. This allows others to find a free time slot in your calendar and reduces the risk of double booking. Then you might want to share event details with specific people in your organization. Or perhaps you're working on a sensitive project and want to restrict access to only others on your team. Note that the default and highest level of sharing allowed for calendars is controlled at the organizational level as a calendar sharing policy. Let's take a moment to review the information in the Integrate calendar settings. If your calendar is public, you can use the public URL to share access to the calendar via the browser, or use the web address in iCal format to share it for access in other apps. The embed code for the calendar can be used to display a Google calendar on a web page with options to customize the way the calendar is presented. When the calendar is embedded, any changes to events will automatically update wherever it is displayed. Remember, after you shared your calendar, you can revoke access at any time by changing permissions.

### Video - [Calendar sharing, visibility and access permissions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528419)

- [YouTube: Calendar sharing, visibility and access permissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79AkI7kSaa8)

person: To change the sharing permissions for your calendar, select "options for" calendar name next to the calendar in your list, and select "settings and sharing" from the menu or select the settings menu and select settings from the menu. Under settings for My Calendars, ensure your calendar is selected. Scroll to access permissions. In the event that you want to make a calendar completely public, which means it can be found via Google search, accessed by anyone who finds it, and embedded in a website, you can check the box to "make available to public." Choose what people see when they access it, "see only free/busy (hide details)" or "see all event details." If you want your coworkers to view your calendar, check the box to "make available for" your organization and the level of access that you want to allow them, "see only free/busy (hide details)," "see all event details," "make changes to events," or "make changes and manage sharing." Everyone in your organization will have the same access to your calendar. Note: access permissions may be configured with a default level of access by your organization. The organization can also limit the level of access you can give to the public to your calendars.

- [YouTube: Delegation options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCLU2Jte2I)

You can also delegate your calendar to someone else, such as a team member or executive assistant. To do so, give the collaborator a minimum of make changes to events permission. And if you want them to have full control of your calendar, assign them make changes and manage sharing. All of your events and their details will be visible to people with these permissions.

### Video - [Share calendar with specific people](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528421)

- [YouTube: Share calendar with specific people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1XTxV0q_Q4)

person: To share a calendar with a specific person, select plus, add people and type the name of the person. Google Calendar will suggest people as you type. You can also share a calendar with a Google group by typing its email address. After you select the person, choose from the following permissions. See only free slash busy hide details. See all event details. Make changes to events, or make changes and manage sharing. Select send to give access to the calendar and notify the person you're sharing it with. Any permission that allows a person to make changes in your calendar will allow them to respond to invitations and create and edit events. Manage sharing permissions allow people to give permissions to other people to the calendar. Again, your organization can limit the sharing options for your calendars.

### Video - [Multiple calendars](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/201/video/528422)

- [YouTube: Multiple calendars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcQzlccwefo)

You might want to have instant visibility to a co-workers schedule. In this case, you can subscribe to their calendar. To add a co-worker's calendar, select add other calendars at the top of the other calendars list. Select subscribe to calendar, and type the person's name in the add calendar box. Google calendar will suggest people as you type. If you have permission to view the calendar will be added to your other calendars list. After the calendar is added, you can also set event notifications and other notifications settings for that calendar. In addition to co-workers calendars, you can also browse resources and calendars of interest, add a public calendar via URL, or import a calendar from a file in iCal or outlook CSV formats. As discussed previously, resources are centrally managed calendars that represent a shared location or thing. Calendars of interest include religious and regional holidays, major sports team schedules, and phases of the Moon. If you have multiple calendars, you can show and hide the events on each calendar using the checkbox to the left of the calendar name in your list. If you haven't already added a colleagues calendar, do so now. Then check and uncheck the box to the left of your colleagues name to view this behavior. You can also choose a color for each calendar to make it easy to determine which events belong to each calendar. Google Calendar allows you to create additional calendars to schedule for a project, an event or any other purpose beyond that of your primary calendar. To create an additional or secondary calendar, select add other calendars at the top of the other calendars list and then select Create new calendar. Give the calendar a name, optionally a description and set the default time zone for events. Then select Create calendar to add it. When the calendar is added, it will appear in your my calendars list beneath your primary calendar. You can then modify the settings for it and add collaborators and viewers. After you've created your additional calendar, you should ensure that you set the permissions correctly. Calendars you've added to your lists, that is the calendars other than your primary calendar and tasks, can be removed when you no longer need to view or interact with them. Select unsubscribe to remove a calendar. This won't remove the calendar from any other Google Calendar user, even if you created it. Alternatively, you can just hide the calendar from your view without unsubscribing from it by deselecting the checkbox to the left of the calendar name or select hide from list from the calendar options pop up to stop viewing it. To view it in your list again, Open Google Calendar Settings and select show in calendar list next to the calendar name.

person: Welcome to module six: customize Google Calendar. Google Calendar allows you to adjust settings to match the way you work. Now that we've covered the key features of Google Calendar, we'll look at how to customize it further using some of the different settings available. In your Calendar settings under language and region, you can specify your language, country and date and time formats. Under view options, set your preferences to see our hide weekends, declined events and week numbers. You can also reduce the brightness of past events so they appear in muted colors on the calendar grid. You can choose your preferred first day of the week, Saturday, Sunday or Monday. In addition to the day, week, month, year and schedule views provided in Google Calendar, you can add your own custom view. For example, you might want to add a view that shows two days at a time. And if you require an alternative to the default Gregorian calendar, select it from the drop down list. The alternate dates will appear below the primary dates on the calendar grid. You can also show calendars side by side. If you select this option, you will see the calendars to which you're subscribed, alongside your own, when viewing your calendar in debut. This is a great way to view other people's schedules. Give it a try. Now, have you ever worked with people across different time zones? Well, Google Calendar supports changing both event and calendar default timezones. To change your timezone for all calendars, open your Google Calendar settings and choose a new primary timezone. You can also change the timezone for a single calendar under calendar settings after selecting the calendar from the list. Guests will always see events in a timezone they have set for their own calendars. Do you need to always see the time in another timezone? Maybe that's where your manager or a teammate is located. Well, Google Calendar lets you display the time in a secondary location. In Google Calendar Settings, select display secondary timezone and choose a secondary time zone from the list. The primary and secondary time zones will appear on the left side of the calendar grid. You can also add a world clock to show multiple time zones. Just check the box for world clock in your settings and add the time zones you want to see. The times will appear along with icons indicating day or night below the mini calendar. Finally, when you create an event, you can choose a different time zone for the event in the details window next to the date and time for the event. In Google Calendar, you can specify the default settings make Calendar work for you. To change the defaults, select event settings under general. From here, you can choose a default duration for new events. Have you ever attended consecutive meetings and not had time to get from one meeting room to another? Well, to avoid that and to encourage quicker meetings, check speedy meetings to end events a few minutes early. Now just watch your productivity soar. You can also change default guest permissions here. Remember, you can change this setting for individual events as needed. An intelligent feature of Google Calendar is offered as part of its integration with Gmail with the events from Gmail setting. This allows Gmail to automatically create an event on your primary calendar by analyzing the content of a Gmail message. For example, if you receive an email confirmation for a flight, or hotel booking, you determine who can see this type of event. You can choose to use your calendar default settings, set these events to be private, or set them to "only me" so that you alone can see the event. Setting working hours in Google Calendar settings will let people know your available hours for meetings, warning them if they invite you to an event outside your hours. This is particularly useful when working with others in different global locations. Check the enable working hours box and set your hours by day.

person: Now it's time to put everything you've learned into practice by taking the business challenge. Before you get started, let's remind ourselves of Thomas's challenge. Over the last three decades, On The Rise partner owners Thomas Omar and Seroga Malone have seen their company grow from a small family business to a global bakery chain. The days of casual on site family meetings are gone, replaced by those of a formal leadership team operating from many countries around the world. Each member of the team is full of great ideas and has the experience and expertise to implement them. Yet, with so many differing individual priorities, Thomas wants to make sure he can narrow the projects down to the critical few and keep his team productive and focused on the bakery's overall strategic objectives. Thomas has asked for your help. He wants to set up recurring leadership team meetings using Google Calendar. He also wants to create a common calendar so he and other team members can track key dates for the strategic On The Rise projects. In the following activity, you will help Thomas and the On The Rise team solve their business challenge using Google Calendar. Good luck.
