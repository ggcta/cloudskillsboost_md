Module 2, call adapter, video 1 In this demo, you learn to navigate the call adapter, identify icons and features of the adapter, check the network strength indicator, select your language, and control your status. The CCAI Platform call adapter is the ultimate agent experience. The modern design is intuitive, smart, and user-friendly. The adapter creates a streamlined and intuitive workflow to optimize productivity and enhance the overall agent experience. The CCAIP call adapter is how you, those with the Agent permissions, can answer and place calls, complete call wrap-up steps, check voicemail, view your network information, and verify your individual performance metrics. Based on the admin configuration, the Adapter may appear within the CRM or the platform. Let’s review the features of the adapter upon login. Select the WiFi icon in the status bar to open the Network menu. In this screen, you will see your current network status and information about your browser permissions. You can also preview your notification sounds in this menu. By using the call’s MOS score, this real-time indicator shows the measure of network strength and when too low, will indicate if the call quality would be impacted. You can click on the indicator to see more information about the current detected signal strength. If you are experiencing network issues, you can send a report from this screen by clicking the Send Report button Back on the main screen, the adapter background is white no matter which status you are in. The bar at the top will change to the color for your selected status. Right now it is red because we are in unavailable status. If I select the caret in the status bar, to open the set your status menu, I can change my status and see the colored bar change with that new status. Along the bottom of the Adapter, we have four buttons. Just a reminder that this is the pre-call menu and actions screen. The first button on the bottom left of the adapter is where you can place outbound calls or answer inbound calls. The next button is where you can see your call history and then sort it by all calls or missed calls. Then you can click the voicemail button and sort by queue or history. And lastly, you can select the options menu by clicking the three dots. There you can make selections about language, and review your stats such as their calls for the day, average call duration, CSAT scores, and sentiment scores. And you can log out from this same options menu.

Module 2, call adapter, video 2 In this demo, you learn to handle incoming and scheduled calls in the adapter, leverage in-call features and complete post-call wrap-up steps Before we begin the demo, here are a couple of reminders: users must be assigned the agent role in order to take calls. Agents must be assigned to queues either directly or they need to be assigned to a team that is assigned to a queue to receive or place calls. Calls coming into the contact center are either auto-answered or agents receive a notification to click to answer. This is based on the configuration set by the admin. If auto answer is enabled for the queue in which you are assigned, the agent who is available the longest will be routed the call and may hear call announcements. At this point, the call will automatically be answered. If auto-answer is not enabled, then the call will still be routed to the agent who has been available the longest but that agent will be presented with a click-to-answer button in the call adapter. Here is the in-call screen. Please note that the features and options available to you while on a call depend on your contact center's configuration. When you need to mute your microphone, but keep the call going, click the mute button The button will remain dark while it is selected. You will click the hold button to put the caller on hold. The caller may hear hold music. And a hold time banner will appear in the in-call menu to show you that you have a call on hold while still allowing your call duration to appear simultaneously. Once you click the transfer/add button, there options will appear here at the top. In the queue tab, you can see all the available queues to transfer to by language. The agent tab allows you to see all agents You can search for them and see their availability. The outside line tab allows you to paste or manually type a number and add it to the existing call. Here is the demo of how to transfer a call or how to add a third party. When utilizing transfer, you can do a warm or cold transfer. Cold transfer is especially useful in a busy contact center where the original agent cannot stay on the line and wait in queue with the caller for the next agent. Let's watch how to do a cold transfer. You will put the caller on hold and then click the transfer button and search for the agent. You'll click to transfer to that agent and end the call before the other agent joins the call. You'll get a notification are you sure you want to leave and you will click leave. Warm transfers can be done with the caller on hold or not on hold, or a combination of both. We suggest putting the caller on hold so that you can bring them in as soon as the transfer is about to be completed rather than taking them through the process. This also gives the agent a chance to give the next agent crucial context about why the caller is being transferred and any other details that will make the experience for the caller smoother. Here's the agent flow. You'll place the caller on hold and then click the transfer button. You'll find the queue or agent you want to transfer to and click transfer. You'll get the notification that it is in the transferring process. Once the new agent comes on the line, you can continue to have that caller on hold to pass along context or information about why the caller is calling in today. You can also see all of the participants in the call and check the call details tab. Once you are ready to bring the caller into the conversation, you can press the hold button again. Finally, we'll practice transferring to an outside party. So we'll click outside line and then we're going to copy and paste or manually enter a phone number into this area of the adapter. Once we've done that we will click to add number And it will dial to connect that third party to this existing phone call. And once that person has picked up the line, you'll see that they have connected with a banner at the top. And the transfer has been completed. Scheduled calls may be another way you will support callers in the CCAIP adapter. You will be placed in a waiting room with a countdown timer prior to a scheduled call. The call will then automatically dial when the countdown timer expires. Once connected, you will have the usual in-call menu options. Let's go back to that main call screen. We are on the second line of button options. Keep in mind these options may vary depending on the contact center's configuration. You can can click the redact button to stop recording. You will see a banner showing that the call is redacted and the duration of that selection. Click the redact button again to resume the call recording. For Agent Assist and SmartActions, you’ll click these two buttons to open menus with further options about what Agent Assist features or SmartActions features you want to utilize which include knowledge assist, payment, co-browse, and more. For in-call SMS, when it is enabled, you will find it down here on the bottom right. Click the SMS tab at the bottom of the screen while in the call to see your message. Depending on your admin-defined access, you may be able to manually type a message and click send with the button on the right side message field. You also may be able to open the SMS shortcut menu by clicking the shortcut button on the left side message field. And now the hang up and call back option. If there is a connection issue and you need to hang up and call the caller back, click this button. The system will hang up and automatically dial the caller to create an outbound call. You will see an Account details record in the in-call menu until the call connects. After a call is disconnected, your screen will move to the post-call actions. There could be quite a few variables in the post-call work you are asked to do. If automatic wrap-up is disabled, once a call is complete there will be a screen indicating the call has ended and you will have the option to call the caller back if needed or move to the next status. If automatic wrap-up is enabled, like you see here on the screen, you will be placed in wrap-up status for a duration set by your admin. Depending on other settings, you may see a wrap-up screen where you can set a disposition code. Or you can add notes. When applicable expand the notes section to see all the notes already entered for the call and add to them if needed. Once you are done with any wrap-up work, click submit to add them to the CRM. If you exceed wrap-up time, your status will automatically change and a banner notification will appear to indicate next steps.

Module 2, call adapter, video 3 In this demo, you learn to handle voicemails, place outbound calls, check Your stats, and log out. Let’s review voicemail. Just a reminder that not all contact center configurations will include the voicemail feature. If yours does, please refer to the following demo to see how you can handle your voicemails in the call adapter. In the call adapter, select the voicemail button at the bottom of the adapter to see the voicemails in queue as well as the voicemail history. The number of voicemails in each mailbox is indicated next to the queue name. If voicemail history is disabled, only the voicemail queue will be visible. The queue tab shows all available unanswered voicemails by queue. The History tab shows all answered voicemails by queue. When listening to voicemails, you have the option to reverse the voicemail by 5 seconds, advance the voicemail by 5 seconds, or pause the voicemail while it is playing. Once the voicemail has finished playing, you can forward, dismiss, or call back. You can switch tabs while listening to voicemail. Click the forward button to advance to the available destinations to forward the voicemail. Based on your configuration you will see queue or agent options, which you can switch between by clicking on the tab not underlined in blue. Select your destination and the voicemail will be forwarded. You will see a confirmation banner when the voicemail has been successfully forwarded. To dismiss a voicemail, click the dismiss button. The dismiss button moves a voicemail to the history category, but it will still create a CRM ticket. Once the Once the Voicemail has finished, you can return the call by clicking call back. If you click the call back button while the voicemail is still playing, you will see a banner with an error message that the action can not be performed while listening to a voicemail. For outbound calls, phone numbers can be clicked to dial when the adapter is embedded in the CRM. You can also manually enter a number (or copy and paste) using the dial pad. Once the number is entered correctly, a screen appears that confirms the customer information. If an account ID is not present, the option to open your CRM is available in the Account ID field so an account can be created. You can click start the call to initiate the dial. By default, all inbound and outbound calls create a new record in your CRM. In your adapter, you may see this more advanced screen for fields for account and record. These fields allow you to associate calls with the correct account in the CRM, and allow you to select which existing record the call should be associated with if you don't want a new record created. The availability of these fields and functionalities are set by your admin so you may see different options. In the options menu area of the adapter, you can check on your stats for the day. Calls today will show how many calls you have been on. With your stats, please keep in mind that successful or positive trending metrics are subjective to the goals of your contact center, so please check with your manager on how your stats rank against their expectations. Generally speaking, here is some context for stats. For average duration, you may assume that lower automatically means better which is not always the case. However, if your average is quite a bit higher than the rest of the teams, consider ways to improve your efficiency when supporting callers. The maximum CSAT number is 5 so you want to be as close to that as possible. Finally, you may see a sentiment score and the maximum score is 100 – so the closer to 100, the better. When you are ready to log out, you will return to the options menu. From here, you can click log out. If you do not log out at the end of the work day, this could affect your success metrics, the contact center’s routing, the agent adherence reports, and more. It's crucial you complete this step before you end your day.

For the first use case let's imagine a consumer calling and outdoor gear company. They purchased climbing gear for their latest expedition in the mountains and as they utilize their trekking poles, one broke on their most recent it. The warranty for the product is outdated but they're hoping that the customer service department might be open to extending the warranty Replacing the trucking poles or offering them a discount on their next purchase to compensate for the inconvenience. Here is that interaction from the agent's perspective. The consumer is calling in through the IVR…titled Product Assistance which appears for agents as the call connects … Once the agent has greeted the consumer the agent puts themselves on mute Perhaps they are in a busy call center or have a noisy agent next to them And this will help reduce background noise for the consumer as they explain the issue with their purchase. Once a consumer has finished talking through their issue with the trekking poles the agent may want to put the interaction on hold to look up the warranty policy. The agent will be able to track how long the caller has been on hold here with the banner. …Once the agent confirms that the warranty policy will not apply to this consumer's purchase but that they can offer a twenty percent refund on the product, The agent will come back to the consumer and click the hold The agent can then leverage redact so that the consumer can share the credit card they would like to receive the twenty percent refund on. The agent doesn't want that information recorded and redact is the way to avoid that. Once done the agent can click redact again and go back to handling the call and resolving the consumer's issue as quickly as possible.
