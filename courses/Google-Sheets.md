Through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities, it's our hope that you'll become more confident using Google Sheets. Google Sheets lets you create and edit spreadsheets directly in a web browser; no special software is required. Multiple users can work simultaneously, you can see individual changes as they're made, and every change is saved automatically. We encourage you to remain signed in to Google Workspace as you complete this course, not just for the activities. You can pause the video lecture or demonstration at any time to explore and practice for yourself, helping to ensure that you understand the topics being discussed. This course follows a fictional customer called On the Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you'll use Google Sheets to solve a business challenge On the Rise is facing. Let's take a look at the scenario you'll use to learn a few key features of Google Sheets. Over the last year, as On the Rise has grown, the size of its employee base has increased significantly. Local stores have been advertising for employees to keep up with both bakery production and customer service demand. The On the Rise leadership team has received several memos from store owners around the world, asking for help as they search for new employees. In one of the leadership meetings, the bakery owners, Thomas Omar and Saroja Malone, returned to the head of HR and employee development, Sherry West, and asked her to provide an up-to-date summary of the number of employment openings and a forecast of upcoming job vacancies. Sherry West has contacted you to help her organize the data she has collected from the various regions. She hopes that by analyzing the numbers, you can help her understand the current employment situation. Ready to get started? Let's begin.

- [YouTube: Introduction to Google Sheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcAniJVy2Vs)

person: Welcome to module 1, Introduction to Google Sheets. Google Sheets is an online spreadsheet program included as part of Google Workspace. In this module, you'll get an introduction to Google Sheets and learn how to open and create a new spreadsheet. We'll also look at how to import an existing spreadsheet into Google Sheets. Google Sheets is a powerful tool for storing, analyzing, and presenting data. You can share your spreadsheets with anyone and edit in real time with collaborators anywhere in the world. With Sheets, you can open, edit, and convert Microsoft Excel files, and your files can be exported into other formats, so you always have access to your information. There are several ways you can create a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets and work with existing spreadsheets. To create a new spreadsheet, navigate to sheets.google.com. This page displays your spreadsheets exclusive of other types of files. Click the plus icon and choose Create New Spreadsheet. If you're already working in a spreadsheet and need to create a new one, navigate to the file menu, hover over New, and choose Spreadsheet. However, the quickest way to create a new spreadsheet is to type sheets.new into your browser address bar. If you haven't already done so, Open Google Sheets by visiting sheets.google.com. Google Sheets spreadsheets are stored in Google Drive. Google Drive is cloud storage for your files. To create a new spreadsheet from Google Drive, select New and choose Google Sheets. A new blank spreadsheet will open in a new browser tab. Your spreadsheets are automatically saved in your My Drive. While you're in Google Drive, if you hover over the arrow next to Google Sheets in the menu, you can also choose to create a spreadsheet from a template. A template is a spreadsheet that's already been formatted for a purpose like an invoice, a timesheet, or expense report. The template gallery shows both general templates provided by Google and your organization's templates, which were submitted by your colleagues and may be more relevant to your workflow. A spreadsheet can be submitted to the template gallery for use by others in your organization. If you have spreadsheets that were created in Microsoft Excel, you can upload them to Google Drive for editing with Google Sheets. You can choose to keep a spreadsheet in the Microsoft Excel format or convert it to Google Sheets. Converting it enables the full capabilities of Google Sheets. Regardless of how you create your spreadsheet, as you edit it, your changes are automatically saved with the history of all the changes by you and any collaborators, so you never lose a keystroke. To name your spreadsheet, select Untitled Spreadsheet and type a name. While you're editing the name, the location of the spreadsheet in Google Drive will be visible next to it. Select it to move your spreadsheet to another location in Google Drive. For fast access to a particular spreadsheet, you can add it to your starred list in Google Drive. Select Star to add a spreadsheet to your starred list. Select See Document Status to check whether your changes have been saved and whether the file is available for offline access. If offline access is not enabled for your Google Drive, you can turn it on from the See Document Status dialog. Once offline access is enabled, you can select File and then Make Available Offline to make a specific file available for viewing and editing offline.

## Manage data using Google Sheets

In this module, we will talk about adding and organizing data with Google Sheets. You will learn how to add, paste and import data. You will also learn how to sort and filter data in your spreadsheets which is especially useful when working with large datasets.

### Video - [Manage data using Google Sheets](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/196/video/528627)

Welcome to Module 2: Manage Data using Google Sheets. After a spreadsheet has been created, data can be added in multiple ways. In this module, we'll explore adding and organizing data with Google Sheets. You'll learn how to add, paste, and import data, and you'll also learn how to sort and filter data in a spreadsheet, which is especially useful when working with large datasets. Spreadsheet data is contained in cells. Cells are identified by their location or address in the spreadsheet by column and row. The cell in the upper-left corner of the spreadsheet is A1, and the cell to its right is B1, and below it is A2. Understanding cell addresses is essential for creating formulas and functions. The simplest way to add data to a spreadsheet is to type numbers or text into a cell. Another option for adding data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet is by pasting it from another source, like from another spreadsheet, or from within the existing sheet, or a Google Doc, et cetera. If the data has been copied to the clipboard of your device, it can be pasted into the sheet. Select a cell or range to paste the data into. To paste, open the Edit menu and select Paste. This is a simple option that will paste the data in with its original format. To choose which formatting to include, hover over Paste Special and choose one of the options. There are several Paste Special options to choose from. Take a moment to explore them. The keyboard shortcuts Ctrl V on Windows and Command V on Mac OS will also work to paste when you are using the Chrome browser. Google Sheets supports importing data from other file formats like Microsoft Excel. The files can be stored either in Google Drive or on your device. To import data, open the File menu and choose Import. To find a file stored in Google Drive, you can browse the My Drive, Shared With Me, Shared Drives, and Recent tabs. Select Upload to browse your device's storage for a file, then choose how to import the data. You can create a new spreadsheet, insert a new sheet, replace the current spreadsheet, replace the current sheet, append new rows to the current sheet, or replace data in a selected cell. Select Import to complete the process. When you're working with datasets, especially very large sets, it can be helpful to sort data to gain fast access to the necessary cells. You can sort an entire sheet by a column, or you can sort a range of cells. To sort the entire sheet, right-click the letter of a column to sort by and choose whether to sort in ascending or descending order. Alternatively, select a column, open the Data menu, then choose Sort Sheet by Column and either A to Z or Z to A. To sort a range, highlight the group of cells you want to sort. Open the Data menu and select Sort Range. Select Add Another Sort Column to choose another column to sort by next. The sorting is processed in order from first selection to last. If your spreadsheet contains header rows, you can freeze these rows so they are not included in the sort. Filtering data can also help with analyzing a subset of the data in your spreadsheet. Select a range of cells to filter. For example, select a column. Then, from the Data menu, select Create a Filter. A Filter button will appear in the top right of the selected range. Select the Filter button to open the filter options menu. You can filter by condition, which includes values and color. You can also search for data points by typing in the Search box. To remove a filter, open the Data menu and select Turn Off Filter to remove it or select the Turn Off Filter icon from the toolbar. Filters can also be saved as filter views, which we'll look at next. When you're working with large datasets in a spreadsheet, the filter view allows you to see just the data that's important and relevant to you without changing the underlying data. To use a filter repeatedly, create a filter view. There are two ways to define the data range for the filter view. Either drag across the rows and columns to highlight the cells to be included before creating the filter view, or manually specify the data range while creating the filter view. To create a filter view, open the Data menu, and select Create filter view. Select Save view and give the filter view a descriptive name when prompted. If you already highlighted the cells to be included in the filter view, the selection will be displayed next to the Range field. This can be edited if required. If you did not highlight a range, select the field next to Range and set the beginning and ending cells for the filter. Click on the X button to close the filter view. Your new filter is now saved, and it will be added to the Filter Views menu for you and other collaborators to use later. Editors of the spreadsheet will be able to change the filter view. Viewers can also create filter views, but they won't be saved.

Welcome to Module 3: Format a Google Sheets spreadsheet. In this module, we'll explore ways to format spreadsheets, like with cell colors and text wrapping, as well as options to freeze cells and protect data in your Google Sheet. Let's start by exploring some of those formatting options.

### Video - [Format a Sheet](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/196/video/528632)

- [YouTube: Format a Sheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arK4bnA4NRI)

person: After data has been added to a spreadsheet, it can be formatted to highlight or organize it. Click to select a cell for formatting, or click and drag to select more than one or a range of cells. Press Ctrl on a Windows device or Command on a Mac, and select multiple cells by clicking on them. From there, you can choose from a number of formatting options. You can change the background color of a cell or range of cells with the Change Fill Color toolbar icon. Select cells A1 to N1. Click the Change Fill Color icon, and change the color to orange. Google Sheets also allows you to set alternating colors by header and row and apply conditional formatting, which assigns a color based on rules for cell contents. Select row one and row two, and change the font weight to bold. Borders are the lines around a cell. Cell borders can be eliminated or styled as appropriate for the display of the data in the sheet. The options for borders include changing the style of the outline, including line thickness, dotted or dashed, and color. Borders can be applied on any side of a cell or group of cells. Select the populated cells in the spreadsheet. Click on the border icon in the toolbar, and assign a solid border. Data can span multiple cells by merging those cells together. cells can be merged horizontally, vertically, or both. Select multiple cells C2 to E2, which represent quarter one, and then click merge cells. Or click the drop-down to select merge type for additional options. Let's also merge quarter two, quarter three, and quarter four. Choose left, right, or center alignment for the cell data. Choose top, bottom, or center alignment for the cell data. Select row one and row two. Then use the format menu to align contents middle and center. When adding data to a cell, long numbers or text strings may fill its visible space. Choose an option for how Sheets deals with displaying the data, overflow, wrap, or clip. Overflow will allow the data to overlap an adjacent cell. Wrapped will resize the cell to accommodate the data entered into it. Clip will display a portion of the data, although all the data will still be figured into formulas and functions. Reduce the width of column B so that the trailing text is no longer visible. Then select column B. From the format menu, choose Text Wrapping and then Wrap. Text entered into a cell can be rotated in nearly any direction. Options for text rotation include tilt up, tilt down, stack vertically, rotate up, and rotate down. If none of these options are appropriate, a custom angle can be applied to text in the cell. Select cells A3 through A7, then merge the cells. In cell A3, from the format menu, choose Text Rotation, then rotate up, align the solid contents middle and center, and increase the font size. Any changes in formatting can be undone or redone by selecting the undo or redo in the toolbar. This will also reverse or apply changes in data entry and calculation, in addition to formatting. Note that formatting is normally applied to all of the data in Excel, but double clicking the cell allows selection of a portion of the data in it, which can be formatted separately.

- [YouTube: Cell types, rows and columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75clmSnlaiA)

person: Cells in Google Sheets can be formatted so that the numbers stored in them are displayed as needed. For example, the cell number can be formatted to display as a currency, so that it includes the dollar symbol, or it can display as the percent value or a time and date. To change a cell's number formatting, select the cell or cells, open the format menu, hover over a number, and choose the format type from the menu. Cells, rows, and columns in Google Sheets can be added, changed, moved, and deleted. To add a single cell, row, or column, right click on it. For rows, right click on its number, and for columns, right click on its letter, and choose the appropriate insert option from the menu. When a cell is inserted, the existing cells are shifted right or shifted down. Rows can be inserted above or below a selected row, and columns can be inserted to the left or right of a selected column. Cells, rows, and columns can also be deleted. When cells, rows, and columns are deleted, the data contained in them will also be deleted. You can also resize cells. To resize a row or column to fit the data in it, double click on the right edge of the column or bottom edge of the row to automatically apply the proper size. Alternatively, right click on the row or column, and choose Resize, and enter the desired size and pixels, or select Fit to Data. To move a row or column, select the letter of the column or number of the row, and the pointer will change to a hand. Click and hold, then drag the column to the left or right, or drag a row up or down. Cells can also be frozen. This can be useful if you want to view a header row while scrolling through many rows of data. Both rows and columns can be frozen. To freeze a row or column, select it, open the view menu, hover over Freeze, and then select 1 row/column, 2 rows/columns, or up to current row/column. A thick gray line will appear at the end of the frozen rows or columns. This line can be dragged later to change the range of cells that are frozen. Freezing header rows at the top of a sheet also ensures that these rows are excluded if you sort your sheet.

person: A Google Sheets spreadsheet can have more than one sheet in order to organize data or to deal with large amounts of data. Every spreadsheet created in Google Sheets has a default sheet named Sheet 1. Select the drop-down next to Sheet 1 to open the menu. The sheet can be duplicated, copied to a new or existing spreadsheet, renamed, protected, moved left or right, or it can even be hidden. To rename a sheet, use the menu, then choose rename, or simply double click on the sheet name to edit it directly. Select All Sheets to see the list of sheets in the spreadsheet. To add a new sheet, select Add Sheet. A new sheet will be added to the right of the current sheet. To move or reorder the sheets, click and drag the sheet tab to the left or right. to duplicate a sheet, click the drop-down and select Duplicate. The new sheet will have the exact same formatting and data. Select Hide from the menu to remove the tab from view. Select All Sheets to reveal any hidden sheets, and click on the name of a hidden sheet to unhide it. To ensure that important data is not edited or deleted from the spreadsheet, choose Protect Sheet, or select Protected Sheets and Ranges from the data menu. The Protected Sheets and Ranges panel will appear on the right side of the sheet. Enter a description. To leave specific cells as editable, select the checkbox next to Accept Certain Cells, and select a range to be left unprotected. Select Set Permissions to set the editing permissions. Choose to either show a warning to those who attempt to edit the range, or restrict editing to a collaborator by typing their name or email address. Sheets will offer suggestions of people based on what is typed in the Add Editors field. Permissions can also be copied from another protected range. By default, the owner decides who can change ranges and sheets. Editors can protect ranges and sheets but cannot limit the access of the owner.

## Basic formulas, functions, and charts

In this module, we will look at creating a basic formula, using functions, named ranges and referencing data. You will also learn how to create a chart, and be introduced to Google Explore, a powerful tool that can be used to answer questions and make suggestions based on insights gained from your data.

Welcome to Module 4: Basic Formulas, Functions, and Charts. Formulas and functions allow you to make quick calculations and better use of your data. Google Sheets supports many of the formulas found in other spreadsheet applications. In this module, we'll cover how to create a basic formula using functions, named ranges, and reference data. You can perform many different types of calculations by using functions to create formulas in Google Sheets. There are hundreds of functions in Sheets that can be used to create formulas to execute all sorts of calculations and manipulate data. To see an up-to-date list of the supported functions, select Help and then Function List. Let's look at how formulas are added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet now.

### Video - [Basic functions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/196/video/528639)

- [YouTube: Basic functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6gJGHuq8ZQ)

person: To create a formula, select a cell and type equals to begin. Google Sheets may suggest one or more functions or ranges for the formula based on the data in the sheet once you begin typing. Type equals into cell C11 to show how Google Sheets suggests an appropriate sum formula for the column. This function box will show the functions based on what has been typed, along with a brief explanation of the functions purpose. Type the open parentheses key to begin selecting a range to apply the formula to. A range can be selected by typing the beginning and ending addresses of the cells in the range, clicking and dragging to select the cells, or by using the arrow keys on the keyboard of your device. To select cells that are not adjacent for the range, hold the Ctrl key on Windows or Command key on Mac OS, and select the cells for the range. As cells are selected for the range, they will be highlighted in the color that their address appears in as part of the formula for easy identification. The formula will also appear and can be edited in the formula bar at the top of the sheet. Functions can also be added to the sheet by selecting functions in the toolbar and selecting one from the menu. While Google Sheets supports many different functions, there are several that are frequently used to make calculations in a spreadsheet. The simplest and possibly most utilized function is sum. Sum returns a sum of the series of numbers and/or cells. Suppose we want to see the sum of the sales for January. Select cell C11, and begin by invoking the function by typing equals sum. Add the range inside parentheses separated by a colon: (C3:C10) The resulting formula will appear as: equals sum (C3:C10) in cell C11, the total of the cells will appear. In fact, a preview of the result of the formula will appear. To apply the formula, hit enter. Selecting that number will display the formula that produced it in the formula bar where it can be modified. Did you notice that Google Sheets actually suggested that formula for me once I started to type into the cell I11? We could repeat the process for all other months, but we can also copy the formula across by simply dragging cell C11 across. Drag the cell C11 to the right as far as N11. Type total sales into A11 to ensure we know what the values in this row represent. Another common function is average. Average returns the numerical average value in a data set, ignoring text. Using the previous example, a formula using average would look like: equals average (C3:C10) Type average into cell O1, then add the formula: average (C3:N3) into cell O3. Note how Sheets suggests the cell range. Before, we were able to drag the total for January across to populate all months. Similarly, we can populate the averages. This time, we can simply double click on the bottom right of cell O3, and this will fill down the formula for us. Sheets will automatically stop at the row where the formula is no longer relevant. Delete the contents of cell O11, and make row 11 and column O bold.

- [YouTube: Summarize data with charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBeCYmrDDIA)

person: With Google Sheets, you can use charts and graphs to present and summarize data. Each chart type represents a different way to display data and can be customized with background colors, fonts, and more. The chart types in Google Sheets include line, column, bar, pie, histogram, and scatter. To create a new chart, select the relevant range of cells to include, open the Insert menu, and select Chart. The Chart Editor panel will open on the right side of the sheet. From the Setup tab, select a chart type from the drop-down list. Each chart type has a colorful image that visually represents what the chart can look like. Other options depend on the chart type you choose. Each chart must reference a data range, and a chart will automatically change as you modify the options in the Chart Editor panel. Click Customize to change options like chart style, chart and access titles, series, legend, and more. You can relocate the chart on the sheet by clicking and dragging. You can also resize the chart by using the anchors in the corners or sides. Next, let's explore and visualize data using charts in Google Sheets.

person: Creating a chart in Sheets is easy. Here we can see sales for two stores in Spain. There are a lot of numbers here, so let's create a chart so we can better visualize the data. Select cells A1 through M3, then choose the insert chart icon on the toolbar, or choose Chart from the insert menu. Expand the chart on the sheet. The chart's editor pane opens on the right, and Sheets automatically chooses the most appropriate chart type for your data. We can change the type in the chart editor. Set the chart to be smooth line type. Now let's explore some of the customization options. Click Customize in the chart editor pane. Expand the chart and axis title section, and change the chart title to Spanish units sold. Change the title font size and color. Suppose we want to see the sales trend for each store. Expand series, and check trend line. Here we can see that there's a slight upward trend in sales for both stores. Let's imagine that all the Spanish stores commit to selling at least 6,000 units per month. In that case, let's reset Start the Baseline, expand vertical axis, and set the minimum value to 6,000. See how the chart now starts at 6,000 units? Finally, let's add the data values to the chart. Expand series, and check the data labels box. You'll have time to explore the chart's editor later. One of the strengths of Google Workspace is that apps like Sheets can connect to other Google services like Google Maps. Let's explore creating geo or map based charts. Select cells A1 through B11. Then choose the insert chart icon on the toolbar, or choose chart from the insert menu. Expand the chart on the sheet. Let's see what this data looks like on a map. Change the chart type to geo chart. Now we can see colors representing the sales in each country. Let's make some changes. Click Customize in the chart editor pane. First, we are only interested in Europe, so let's change the map to display Europe only. Let's change the colors also. Change the min, mid, and max values to light blue three, light blue one, and dark blue one respectively. If we hover over each country, we can see the number of units sold. Let's imagine we've opened a store in Dublin. In row 12, enter Ireland and 350,000. Notice how Sheets automatically adds the new store to the chart. We didn't even have to adjust the chart's range. Sheets also allows you to show a simple chart in a cell. Let's see that now. Enter the following formula into cell N2: Equal sign sparkline (B2:M2) Sparkline allows you to visualize a range of cell data in a single cell. Like any formula, we can push that down to other rows in the sheet. Double click on the bottom right corner of cell N2 to reveal the sparkline for Barcelona in row three.

- [YouTube: Import, export, date types, and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d5oIIo0WY0)

Once you've added a chart to a sheet, click the More Options button on the upper right corner of the chart to edit, delete, download, publish, or copy the chart. You can also choose to move the chart to its own sheet. To make the chart public, choose Publish chart. It can be shared via a link or embedded in a website. To create a link to a chart, click Link on the Publish to the web card. A unique link will be created and displayed, which can be copied and pasted anywhere. When publishing a chart, you can choose to publish just the chart, a sheet, or the entire spreadsheet, and choose to make it interactive or just an image. Click the embed tab to create an embed code for adding a chart to a website. Again, choose to publish the chart, the sheet, or the entire spreadsheet, and whether it will be interactive or an image. Google Sheets will generate custom embed HTML code. If you're comfortable doing so, you can modify the code to add it to a website. To use the embed code, copy and paste it. Click Stop publishing at any time to disable public access to the chart. There are many ways for dates to be expressed in a spreadsheet. In Google Sheets, a cell, or range of cells, or an entire sheet can have a specific date format applied to it. To apply a format, select the data or area, open the Format menu, hover over Number, and select from the predefined date and time formats, Date, Time, Date time, and Duration. For more options, hover over More Formats, and select More date and time formats. The Custom date and time formats dialog will appear from which you can apply further customizations. You can choose from the predefined list of date and time display options. In addition to formatting, Google Sheets also has over 20 functions to display, format, or calculate a date. When you're working with datasets in Google Sheets, naming data ranges can improve accuracy and efficiency. After a range is named, it can be referenced by that name in a formula. So, instead of a formula for calculating sales results for the year being written as =SUM(A3:D15), it can be =SUM(monthly_results), which is easier to read and easier for collaborators to understand when editing a sheet. To add a named range, open the Data menu, and select Named Ranges. Alternatively, right-click on a cell or selected range, and select Define named range from the menu. The Named ranges panel will open on the right side of the sheet. Enter a name for your named range. If necessary, click to enter the range address, or select it in the sheet. Then click Done. The named range can then be referenced in formulas in the sheet.

## Share your Google Sheets spreadsheets

In this module, we will look at the different ways to share your spreadsheets with others. You will learn how to add collaborators and assign them roles and permissions, and also learn how you can share your Google Sheets spreadsheet with a link. You will understand how to transfer ownership of your spreadsheets to another collaborator, track changes, and manage versions.

person: Welcome to Module 5, Share your Google Sheets spreadsheets. Google Sheets spreadsheets are easy to share. In this module, we'll look at the different ways to share spreadsheets with others. You'll learn how to add collaborators, assign those collaborators roles and permissions, and share your Google Sheets spreadsheets with a link. In addition, you'll learn how to transfer ownership of a spreadsheet to a collaborator, track changes, and manage versions. Google Sheets spreadsheets are easy to share. Just click Share to get started. The sharing window allows you to choose who can access your spreadsheet. To share a spreadsheet with someone, type their name or email address in the Add People and Groups box. You can add more than one person or even a Google group to share with more than one person at once. Choose whether to notify people by email and whether or not to add a custom message. Click Send to share the Google Sheet. When you create a Google Sheet spreadsheet, you're the owner. As the owner, you can change the content, add collaborators, download it, print it, copy it, transfer ownership to another collaborator, and delete it. You grant others access to your spreadsheet by assigning them a collaborator role. A role determines an individual's level of access to the spreadsheet. Collaborators can be editors, commenters, or viewers. Permissions are actions that can be performed by an individual according to their assigned role. Editors can change the content of the file, download it, print it, and copy it, but they cannot transfer ownership or delete it. Depending on the spreadsheet settings, editors may or may not be able to change permissions and share the file with others. Commenters can view and add comments to the spreadsheet but cannot change it. Viewers can only view the spreadsheet. Commenters and viewers can download, print, and copy the spreadsheet as long as the owner allows it. Permissions can be changed at any time, including removing collaborators entirely or transferring ownership of the spreadsheet to another editor. Click Share to view your collaborators and their permissions. Selecting the Share With People settings gear icon exposes two additional options which are enabled by default. The editors' ability to share the spreadsheet can be removed. In addition, download, print, and copy options can be removed from viewers and commenters. You can also choose to set an expiration date for any viewer or commenter. After that date, the collaborator will no longer have access to the spreadsheet. This might be useful if, for example, you have asked for feedback, but you require feedback by a certain date. Sharing can also be done with a link which is unique to the spreadsheet. By default, the link is restricted to only allow people who have been added as collaborators to access the spreadsheet with their assigned permissions. You can choose to widen the scope of the link to all users in your own organization, or you can make it available to anyone. You must also set the link's permission. Use care when sharing a spreadsheet in this way. Anyone who has a link can share it with other people, who will be able to access the spreadsheet with the link's permissions. Occasionally, you may want to assign a new owner. To change the owner, first add the owner as a collaborator with the editor role. Then, from the Sharing window, select the new owner, then select Editor next to that person's name. Click Transfer Ownership and select Share. After you transfer ownership of a spreadsheet, you'll become an editor, but the new owner can remove you as a collaborator. Google Sheets keeps track of all the changes made to this spreadsheet by all of the editors. To view the history of a spreadsheet, select File, hover over Version History, and select See Version History. The Versions browser will appear. Versions are listed chronologically from newest to oldest in the panel on the right side of the screen. Select a date to expand a more granular view of the edits. Select an edit to see what the change was and who made it. Each editor and their edits are represented with a specific color. You can also select more options to make copy of the spreadsheet at that point in time, or to create a named version. If you've created named versions, you can use the Only Show Named Version slider to filter out any versions that are not named. At any time, you can select an edit and click Restore This Version to return the spreadsheet to the state it was at the selected time. Google Sheets spreadsheets can also be downloaded to your computer and edited in other apps or shared with people. Select File, hover over Download, and choose the format to download the spreadsheet. Once downloaded, the files may not be viewable or editable on your device and are no longer subject to the permissions for viewing and editing that they were in Google Sheets.

## Collaborate with Google Sheets

In this module, we will look at some of the collaboration options available to you with Google Sheets. Examples include commenting, action items, and notifications.

Welcome to Module Six: Collaborate with Google Sheets. Google Sheets makes it easy to collaborate with teams, clients, and partners, wherever they are. In this module, we'll look at some of the collaboration options available with Google Sheets, like commenting, action items, and notifications. When collaborating on a Google Sheet spreadsheet, editors and commenters can use comments for discussions and action items. To add a comment, select a cell in the spreadsheet, then select "Comment" from the Insert menu, or click the "Insert comment" toolbar icon. Cells with comments are identified by a small amber triangle in the top right corner of the cell. To reply to a comment, hover over the cell with a comment to reveal the comment card, then click on the card and type a reply. You can also send a comment to a specific person. To do this, mention a person in the comment by typing + or @ before their name, and then choose from the suggested contacts, or type their email address. Select "Comment" to send them a message or add them to the discussion. If they don't have access to the spreadsheet, a prompt will appear where you can choose the appropriate sharing permission to grant them: comment or edit. Remember, you can also use the "Turn link sharing on" option so that anyone with the link to the spreadsheet can comment. If you mention a person when you create a new comment, a checkbox will appear, allowing you to assign the comment to that person as an action item. Checking the box will notify the person and make them responsible for marking it as done. To resolve a comment, select the checkmark on the comment card to mark as resolved and hide discussion. You can also select "More options" to edit a comment or delete it. From the "More options" menu, you can get a direct link to this comment. That link will take collaborators directly to the location in the spreadsheet where the comment was added. As comments are added, edited, and resolved in a spreadsheet, you can view all the comments by selecting "Open comment history" next to the "Share" button. From the comment history, you can view edit, delete, resolve, link to, and reopen comments. Selecting any of the comment cards in the history will move you to the place in the sheet where the comment was added. To manage notifications for comments in the spreadsheet, open the comment history and select "Notifications." Choose which notifications you want to receive. You can choose from "All," "Only yours," or "None."

person: When you and a collaborator are simultaneously editing a spreadsheet, their Google account profile photo or first initial will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the spreadsheet. To chat with them in real time, select Show Chat to open the chat panel in the sheet. All collaborators will be able to see the chat. If the spreadsheet is shared publicly, anonymous animals will appear next to the Show Chat icon. They represent people viewing this spreadsheet who are not logged in to a Google account. With Gmail support for dynamic emails, notifications from Google Sheets can be responded to without having to open the document. Review the comment and type your response in the Reply box. From the Google Sheets File menu, you can email the spreadsheet to others as a PDF or choose from the other file formats. You can also choose to email your collaborators. By default, all collaborators are included as recipients, but you can remove any of them or choose the recipients based on the permissions they have for the spreadsheet.

person: Now it's time to put everything you've learned into practice. Before you get started, let's remind ourselves of the business challenge. Over the last year, as On The Rise has grown, the size of its employee base has increased significantly. Local stores have been advertising for employees to keep up with both bakery production and customer service demand. The On The Rise leadership team has received several memos from store owners around the world, asking for help as they search for new employees. In one of the leadership meetings, the bakery owners, Thomas Omar and Saroja Malone turned to the head of HR and Employee Development, Sherrie West, and asked her to provide an up-to-date summary of the number of employment openings and a forecast for upcoming job vacancies. Sherrie West has contacted you to help her organize the data she has collected from the various regions. She hopes that by analyzing the numbers, you can help her understand the current employment situation. In the following activity, you'll help Sherrie West and the On The Rise team solve their business challenge using Google Sheets. Good luck.
