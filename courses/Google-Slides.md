person: Hello and welcome. In this course, we will introduce you to Google Slides, Google's cloud based presentation software included with Google Workspace. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities, you'll become more confident using Google Slides. Google Slides presentations are stored safely in the cloud. With Google Slides, you can create and present professional presentations for sales, projects, training modules, and much more. You build presentations right in your web browser. No special software is required. Even better, multiple people can work on your slides at the same time, you can see people's changes as they make them, and every change is automatically saved. We encourage you to stay signed into Google Workspace throughout the course, not just for the activities. You can pause the video lecture or demonstration at any time and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer On the Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you will use Google Slides to solve a particular business challenge being faced by On the Rise. So let's take a look at the scenario we'll be using as you learn some key features of Google Slides. Thomas Omar and Saroja Malone met with On the Rise store owner Youssef Ahmadi on a recent visit to the store's Fort Lauderdale, Florida location. Over dinner after the meeting, Youssef discussed his ideas about improving how On the Rise bakeries share their successes, their challenges, and their lessons learned. He said, "I would love to find a way to learn about how other stores are set up, how they entice their customers to try new products and services, and how they make their bakeries more efficient. This idea resonated with Thomas. He noted that he recently received a similar presentation from the Manila store named On the Rise Bakery Best Practices Sharing. He asked whether Youssef would be willing to build off of this presentation by adding a new section about what is happening at On the Rise Fort Lauderdale. Thomas would like to eventually share the presentation with other On the Rise store owners, so they can add new sections, too. Youssef has agreed to take on this new project. Okay, ready to get started? Great, let's begin.

person: Welcome to module 1, Introduction to Google Slides. In this first module, we will open Google Slides and explore the options available to you for creating a new presentation. Google Slides is a smart, powerful presentation app. Create, view, and edit your presentations, all with just a web browser. Your presentations can be easily shared with anyone, and they can be edited in real time with collaborators anywhere in the world. Google Slides can also open, edit, and convert Microsoft PowerPoint files. And you can export a Google Slides presentation into several other formats, so you always have access to your presentations. Go to slides.google.com to view only your presentations, exclusive of other types of files in Google Drive. To create a new presentation, click the plus icon. Alternatively, simply type slides.new into your browser address bar to create a blank presentation. Google Slides are stored in Google Drive. Google Drive is cloud storage for any file. To create a new presentation in Google Drive, type drive.google.com in the address bar of your browser to open Google Drive, and then select New and choose Google Slides. A new blank presentation will open in a new browser tab. From Google Drive, if you hover over the arrow next to Google Slides in the menu, you can also choose to create a new presentation from a template. A template is a slides presentation that has already been formatted and saved to the template library for others to use. All users have access to general templates, and templates that were created by people in your organization might also be available. You can also choose a template for your new presentation if you're working directly in Google Slides at slides.google.com. To name a new presentation, select untitled presentation at the top of the page, then type a name. While you're editing the name, the location of the presentation in Google Drive will be visible next to it. Select it to move your presentation to another location. For fast access to a particular presentation, you can add it to your starred list in Google Drive. Select star to add your presentation to your starred list. Select see document status to check whether your changes are saved and whether the file is available for offline access. If offline access is not enabled for your Google Drive, you have the opportunity to turn it on from the See Document Status dialog. When offline access is enabled, you can select File and then Make Available Offline to make a specific file available for viewing and editing offline. Let's see how to create a new presentation now.

## Manage Google Slides

Google Slides can contain many different types of content, including text, images, and videos. In this module we'll explore some of the ways you can create and manage slides using the formatting tools available.

### Video - [Manage Google Slides](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197/video/528968)

Welcome to module 2, Manage Google Slides. Google Slides can contain many different types of content, including text, images and videos. In this module, we'll explore some of the ways you can create and manage slides using the formatting tools available. Google Slides presentations have themes. Themes include colors, fonts, backgrounds, and slide layouts. Each new presentation is formatted with the Google default theme, but you can choose another theme to suit your requirements from the themes panel. If the themes browser panel is closed, select Change Theme from the slide menu, or click the Change Theme button in the toolbar to open it again. Then choose the theme you want to apply to your presentation. You can also customize your selected theme by selecting View and then Theme builder to open the layouts browser. You can make any style changes that you want. Don't worry though, any changes you make to the Theme are only to your presentation. Themes can also be imported from another slides presentation stored in Google Drive or from PowerPoint files uploaded from your device. select Import Theme from the bottom of the themes browser, choose the presentation to import, select a slide thumbnail, and select Import Theme to apply it. A presentation begins with a single slide with the title slide layout. There are several ways to add a new slide. You can open the insert menu and select New Slide, or you can open the slide menu and select New Slide. You can select the new slide toolbar icon, or from the slides browser, right click anywhere and choose new slide. Layouts are templates for content on an individual slide. There are several layouts to choose from with font styles and sizes in text boxes, image placeholders, and backgrounds. To apply a layout to a slide, open the slide menu and hover over Apply Layout to open the layout thumbnails. You can also right click on the slide and select Apply Layout. After you apply a layout, you can modify any of its elements on the slide. To create a new slide with a specific layout, select the new slide with layout drop down to the right of the new slide toolbar icon and choose your desired layout.

## Enhance Google Slides

Using visuals to tell your story is a great way to capture your audience, summarize information, illuminate processes, and highlight key findings. With Google Slides, you have the option of adding shapes, tables, images, charts, and more. You can also add transitions and animations. In this module, we'll look at some of the enhancements available in Google Slides.

person: Welcome to Module Three, Enhance Google Slides. Using visuals to tell your story is a great way to capture your audience, summarize information, illuminate processes, and highlight key findings. With Google Slides, you have the option of adding shapes, tables, images, charts, and more. You can also add transitions and animations. In this module, we'll look at some of the enhancements available in Google Slides. Let's start by taking a look at just a couple of objects that can be inserted into your Google Slides presentation.

### Video - [Add images and tables](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197/video/528978)

- [YouTube: Add images and tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWwVOUdwYQ)

person: Inserting images is a great way to bring your slide to life. Open the Insert menu to add visuals. Images can be added to a document from your computer, the web, Google Drive and more. Place the cursor where you want to insert the image and select Image from the Insert menu. Choose the location of your image. Search the web opens a Google Images search panel within the presentation where you can search by keywords, preview images, and select one or more to insert. Choosing Photos opens a search panel of your Google Photos and albums. Adding by URL inserts an image via the web address of the image. If your device has a camera, a photo can be taken by selecting Camera. Select Insert to add the photo to the presentation. Drag the image to resize it, rotate it, or move it around the presentation. To add a table, hover over a table and then drag your mouse pointer over the squares in the grid to choose the size of the table. Each square from left to right represents a column. Each square from top to bottom represents a row. Once you've inserted the table into the presentation, you can edit it by adding or deleting rows or columns, change the borders and cell backgrounds, the alignment and more.

- [YouTube: Inserting objects into Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvjh_GqtBHU)

person: Adding audio and video to a slide can enhance the story the presentation is created to tell. To add a video, open the Insert menu and select Video. Choose your video from Google Drive, a YouTube search, or a direct URL. To add an audio file, open the Insert menu and select Audio. Audio files have to be stored in Google Drive. Slides supports the playback of both MP3 and WAV files. Like any object, you can place the audio and video anywhere on the slide. Video and audio objects also have several formatting options. After you have added the object, right click on the video or audio to open the Format Options panel. For videos, you can change the start and end times for playback, choose whether to autoplay the video when presenting the slide, and choose whether to also play the audio if the video has it. For audio files, you can choose whether to have the audio play automatically when presenting the slide or to play only when selected. If the audio is set to play automatically, the audio icon can be hidden on the slide. You can set the volume of the audio along with whether to loop it and whether it should stop playing when the slide is not being presented. Adding a chart from Google Sheets to a presentation creates a dynamic connection to the data in the spreadsheet. After you insert the chart, it can be updated with a click if the data in the original spreadsheet is modified. To add a chart, select Insert, hover over Chart, and select From Sheets. Select the spreadsheet from the search box and then select a chart from the spreadsheet. Google Slides has several options for creating diagrams to present data and information on the slide. Open the Insert menu and select Diagram to open the diagrams panel to choose a type. Options include grid, hierarchy, timeline, process, relationship and cycle. Select a type and then choose the number of levels for the diagram along with the primary color. Select the thumbnail preview of the diagram to insert it into the slide. After the diagram is on the slide, it can be dragged to a position. Double click on the diagram to begin editing the text.

- [YouTube: Transitions and animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RKHsfBI-zo)

person: Slide transitions and object animations can make presentation come to life. To add transitions and animations, select an object on a slide, open the Insert menu, and select Animation. Alternatively, open the Slide menu and select Transition. The Motion panel will open to expose the options for both slide transition and object animations. To add a slide transition, select the drop down menu and choose from one of the options. The transition you choose will apply to only the current slide, but if you want the same transition throughout the presentation, select Apply to All Slides. To add an object animation, select one or more objects on a slide and select Add Animation in the Motion panel. Select the drop down menu to choose one of the animations. For example, you might want an icon to fade into the slide or have a bulleted list fly in from the left. Then choose when the animation of the object will occur. You can specify on click, after previous, or with previous. Finally, you can also specify the speed of the animation. Each object on the slide can have its own animation. The animations will happen in the order they are displayed in the Motion panel from top to bottom. After an animation has been added, you can select the drag handle on the animation to reorder it to suit. It's sometimes helpful to group objects on a slide, for example, to make it easy to move objects together and apply formatting. To group objects together, select two or more elements by either holding the Control key on the keyboard and selecting each one or left clicking on an empty part of the slide and dragging to draw a selection box around all the objects. Open the Arrange menu and select Group. The objects will move in unison and formatting may be applied to all of the objects at once when the group is selected. Select the group and choose a range then ungroup to remove the relationship between the objects.

## Organize Google Slides

There are many ways to speed up your workflow when working with Google Slides. In this module, we'll look at some of the options, including duplicating and ordering your slides, importing existing slides, copying slides, and hiding (or skipping) slides.

### Video - [Organize Google Slides](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197/video/528989)

- [YouTube: Organize Google Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svwsRG7BSRs)

person: Welcome to Module Four, Organize Google Slides. There are many ways to speed up your workflow when working with Google Slides. In this module, we'll look at some of the options including duplicating and ordering your slides, importing existing slides, copying slides, and hiding or skipping slides. You may want to add a new slide which includes some or all of the elements of an existing slide. Instead of creating a new slide, you can simply duplicate the existing slide. Then make the changes you need to complete your new slide. To duplicate a slide, right click the slide in the Preview panel and select Duplicate Slide from the menu or open the Edit or Slide menus and select Duplicate. You can also duplicate multiple slides at once by selecting them first in the Preview panel. To reorder slides, select and drag the slides up or down the Preview panel or select the slide menu, hover over Move Slide, and choose an option from the menu-- up, down, to the end, or to the beginning of the presentation. You might find it easier if you first select the grid view at the bottom of the Preview panel to see larger thumbnail views of each slide when selecting and dragging to reorder. Google Slides supports the importing of slides from presentations that are stored in Google Drive. Open the File menu and select Import Slides. On the Import Slides dialog, browse or search the presentation stored in Google Drive, or select upload to import slides from a presentation stored on your device. Select a presentation by choosing the thumbnail preview of the first slide. The slide chooser will load all of the slides in the presentation. Select each slide to import or choose all in the right-hand corner of the dialog. Clear the Keep Original Theme checkbox to import only the content of the slides and apply the current theme to the imported slides, and then select Import Slides to add them to your presentation. If you have presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint format, you can also upload them to Google Drive to edit them in Slides. Note that you are actually editing the PowerPoint formatted file from inside Google Slides, so it remains a PowerPoint presentation. Alternatively, you can convert PowerPoint presentations to Google Slides format for access to features that are specific to Google Slides. As you saw earlier, you can also apply a PowerPoint theme to a Slides presentation. Copying a slide adds it to the clipboard where it can be pasted anywhere in the presentation. To copy a slide, right click on the slide in the Preview panel and select Copy from the menu or open the Edit menu and select Copy. Select any slide in the Preview panel or click between any slides in the Preview panel and then right click and select Paste to insert the copied slide. Slides can also be copied from one presentation to another using this same method. When you are presenting slides, some content may not be relevant to or need to be seen by a particular audience. To hide or skip a slide when presenting, right click on the slide in the Preview panel and select Skip Slide. Skipped slides will appear dimmed in the Preview panel. When you hover over the slide, a message says that the slide will be skipped when presenting

## Share your Google Slides

In this module, we will look at the different ways to share your Google Slides presentations with others. We will discuss collaborator roles permissions, and you will learn how to track changes and manage versions of your presentations. We will also look at how you can publish your presentations to the web and Google Slides download options.

Welcome to Module Five: Share Your Google Slides. In this module, we will look at the different ways to share your Google Slides presentations with others. We will discuss collaborator roles permissions, then you will learn how to track changes and manage versions of your presentations. We will also look at how you can publish your presentations to the web and Google Slides download options. Google Slides presentations are easy to share. Just select "Share" to get started. The sharing window will appear so you can choose who can access the presentation. To quickly share a presentation with someone, type their name or email address in the "Add people and groups" box. You can add more than one person or enter a Google group email address to share with many people at once. You can also choose whether or not to notify the collaborators by email. A custom message can be added too. When you create a presentation, you are the owner. As the owner, you can change the content, add collaborators, download it, print it, copy it, transfer ownership to another collaborator, and delete it. You grant others access to your presentation by assigning them a collaborator role. A role determines an individual's level of access to the presentation. Collaborators can be editors, commenters, or viewers. Permissions are actions that can be performed by an individual according to their assigned role. Editors can change the content of the presentation, download it, print it, and copy it, but they cannot transfer ownership or delete it. Depending on the presentation settings, editors may or may not be able to change permissions and share the presentation with others. Commenters can view and add comments to the presentation, but cannot change it. Viewers cannot change the content of the presentation or add comments, but they can view it, download it, print it, or copy it, as long as the owner allows it. Permissions can be changed at any time, including removing collaborators entirely or transferring ownership of the presentation to another editor. Select "Share" to view your collaborators and their permissions. Selecting the "Share with people" settings gear icon exposes two additional options which are enabled by default. The editors ability to share the presentation can be removed. In addition, download, print and copy options can be removed from viewers and commenters. You can also choose to set an expiration date for any viewer, commenter, or editor. Next to the person's name, select the down arrow and then Add expiration. Select the future expiration date, and Save. Once the expiration date has passed that collaborator will no longer have access to the presentation. This might be useful if, for example, you require a collaborator to have access for the duration of a project only. The owner of a presentation can assign ownership to any collaborator who has editor access. To change ownership, select "Share" to open the sharing window. Select the new owner and select "Editor" next to that person's name. Select "Transfer ownership" and select "Share." After you transfer ownership of the presentation, you will become an editor. But the new owner can remove you as a collaborator. We've just discussed how you can share your presentation with specific users and groups. You can also share with a link. Let's look at that now.

- [YouTube: Share your presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvq5_c5wBlg)

person: Sharing can also be done with a link. Links can be shared via email, on a website, in a Doc, Sheet, or other Slide presentation, or any number of other ways. Links are unique to the presentation and can't be customized. By default, the link for presentation only allows the people who have been added to the presentation to access it with their assigned permissions. Select "Copy Link" to copy it to your device's clipboard. Select "Change to anyone with the link" to generate a link that anyone can access to view the presentation. Select "Viewer" to change the permission to "Commenter" or "Editor."

- [YouTube: Version management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_haJvKTaZk)

person: Google Slides keeps track of all of the changes made to the presentation by all of the editors. To view the history of a presentation, select File, hover over "Version history," and select "See version history." The versions browser will appear. Versions will be listed chronologically from newest to oldest in a panel on the right side of the screen. Select a date to expand a more granular view of the edits. Select an edit to see what the change was and who made it. Each editor and their edits will be represented by a specific color. Select "More options" to make a copy of the presentation at that point in time, or to create a named version. If you have created named versions, you can enable the "Only show named versions" slider to filter out any versions that are not named. At any time, you can choose an edit and select "Restore this version" to return the presentation to the state it was at the selected time.

person: To make a Google Slides presentation visible to anyone, you can publish it to the web. The presentation can be shared via a unique link or embedded in a website. To publish the Google Slides presentation, open the File menu and select "Publish to the web." You'll be presented with choices such as "Publish via a link," how often to auto advance slides, whether to start the slideshow automatically, and whether the slideshow should restart after it ends. There is also an option to require the viewer to be signed in to your organization's Google workspace account before they can see the presentation. Select "Publish" to generate the link. Google Slides presentations can be downloaded to your computer for editing in other apps or sharing with people. Select File, hover over Download and choose a format to download the document. It's important to note that these formats may not be viewable or editable on your device, and downloaded files are no longer subject to the permissions that were set in Google Slides.

## Collaborate with Google Slides

In this module we'll discuss how to use comments effectively to support the development of your presentations. You'll learn how to add comments to your slides, assign an action item, resolve a comment, and view the comment history.

### Video - [Collaborate with Google Slides](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197/video/529002)

- [YouTube: Collaborate with Google Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khNNZik6dxM)

person: Welcome to Module six: Collaborate with Google Slides. Google Slides offers many features that make team collaboration easy. In this module, we will look at how you can use these features to communicate with your team. We will also talk about how Google Slides integrates with Gmail to make collaboration even simpler. When collaborating on a Google Slide, editors and commenters can use comments for discussions and action items. Comments will appear in cards on the right side of the slide. There are several ways to add a comment to a slide. You can apply a comment to the entire slide, or you can select any content in the presentation: a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, image, chart, et cetera. To add a comment, open the Insert menu and select "Comment." Or right click and choose "Comment" from the menu. You can also use the "Add comment" icon in the toolbar, or add a new comment from the Comment History dialog. The comment card will appear on the right edge of the document. Type your comment in the text box and select "Comment." You might want to send a comment to a specific person. To do this, you can mention a person in a comment by typing the + or @ character, then start typing their name or email address. Google will make suggestions for you as you type. Select "Comment" to send them a message and add them to the discussion. When you mention a person in a new comment, a checkbox will appear to allow you to assign the comment to them. Selecting the box will notify the person or make them responsible for marking it as done. The person assigned can reply to the comment or select the checkbox in the comment card to mark it as done and hide the discussion. If the person receiving the comment or being assigned the action item needs access to the presentation, a dialog box will pop up asking for permission to share access to the presentation. You can choose the sharing permission to grant them the ability to comment or edit. To reply to an existing comment or action item, select the comment card and type in the reply box. Select "Reply to comment" and add your reply. The content connected to a comment will appear with a yellow background in the slide or speaker notes until the comment is resolved or deleted. To resolve a comment, select the checkbox on the comment card to mark as resolved and hide discussion. You can also select "More options" to edit a comment, delete it, or get a link to this comment. The link leads directly to the comment. Send it to a collaborator and the link will take them directly to this comment in the presentation. As comments are added, edited, and resolved in the presentation, you can view all the comments by selecting "Open comment history" next to the "Share" button. From the comment history, you can view, edit, delete, resolve, link to, and reopen comments. Selecting any of the comment cards in the history will move you to the place in the presentation where the comment was added.

## Business challenge

In this module, you will put everything you have learned into practice by helping our fictional Google Workspace customer solve their business challenge.

### Video - [Business challenge overview](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197/video/529013)

- [YouTube: Business challenge overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COB89tSuGOw)

person: Now it's time to put everything you've learned into practice. Before you get started, let's remind ourselves of the business challenge. Thomas Omar and Saroja Malone met with On The Rise store owner, Youssef Ramadi on a recent visit to the store's Fort Lauderdale, Florida location. Over dinner, after the meeting, Yusef discussed his ideas about improving how On The Rise bakeries share their successes, their challenges, and their lessons learned. He said, "I'd love to find a way to learn about "how other stores are set up, "how they entice their customers to try new products and services, and how they make their bakeries most efficient." This idea resonated with Thomas. He noted that he recently received a similar presentation from the Manila store named "On The Rise Bakery Best Practices Sharing." He asked whether Yousef would be willing to build off of this presentation by adding a new section about what is happening at On The Rise Fort Lauderdale. Thomas would like to eventually share the presentation with other On The Rise store owners so they can add new sections too. Yusef has agreed to take on this new project. In the following activity, you will help the On The Rise team solve their business challenge using Google Slides. Good luck.

person: Congratulations on completing the course. We do hope that you found it useful. Let's take a moment to review what you've learned. We started with the basics. You learned how to open Google Slides and how to create a new blank presentation and a presentation from a template. You then learned about slide layouts and how to apply a theme to your presentation. You also explored how to enhance your slides by inserting objects such as text, video, and audio. You learned how to improve efficiency by organizing your slides using the copy, reorder, duplicate, and import slides features. You also learned how to collaborate with others in real time, wherever they are in the world, using comments and action items. Having completed your presentation, you now understand how to present them in order to engage your audience. And finally, you took some of the learning from the course to help solve a business challenge being faced by our fictional Google workspace customer, On The Rise. We hope that you enjoyed the course and are now confident using Google Slides. As a cloud application, Google is adding new features all the time, so do continue to explore them as they are rolled out.
