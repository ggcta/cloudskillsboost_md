# [Engineer Data for Predictive Modeling with BigQuery ML](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/627)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Engineer Data for Predictive Modeling with BigQuery ML skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: building data transformation pipelines to BigQuery using Dataprep by Trifacta; using Cloud Storage, Dataflow, and BigQuery to build extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows; and building machine learning models using BigQuery ML.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete the skill badge course, and final assessment challenge lab, to receive a digital badge that you can share with your network.

## Engineer Data for Predictive Modeling with BigQuery ML

### Lab - [Creating a Data Transformation Pipeline with Cloud Dataprep](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/627/labs/490566)

Cloud Dataprep by Alteryx is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data for analysis. In this lab, you explore the Dataprep user interface (UI) to build a data transformation pipeline.
