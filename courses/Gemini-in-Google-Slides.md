You can easily access Gemini in Google Slides by visiting slides.google.com in your browser. If you haven't already, open an existing presentation or start a new presentation. In this lesson, you learn how to use the image generation feature to create unique visuals for your presentation. In the toolbar, select Create image with Gemini. In addition to being able to access "Create image with Gemini" from the toolbar, you can also access this feature by going to the Google Slides menu. Choose Insert, Image, Create image with Gemini. You can also right-click on any image and choose Replace image, Create image with Gemini. A sidebar opens for creating an image with Gemini. In the sidebar, is a text input for describing your idea for the image. This is where you enter your prompt. Perhaps you are in sales and creating a slide deck to pitch your new laundry folding robot. You want to show the need for your product by explaining how much laundry affects people. You want to do this by showing a visual of messy laundry all over a room. The prompt to generate this image can include information about the type of room, where the messy laundry is located, and more. For example, "Messy primary bedroom filled with unfolded laundry all over the floor, bed, and cabinets". Or perhaps you work in human resources and are creating a presentation for training warehouse workers on proper safety in the warehouse. You want to add an image showing hands putting on working gloves. The prompt to generate this image can include the type of gloves, and a description of the setting. For example, "Hands putting on work gloves in a warehouse." Regardless of the visual you're trying to generate, it's important to provide a descriptive prompt to help Gemini understand what you're looking for. A descriptive prompt might include specifics such as the subject, setting, distance to the subject, materials, Or background. After you type your prompt, click Create. You might need to wait several seconds for Gemini to generate a response. Depending on your prompt, you will usually receive a few visual options. When you find a suggested image that you like, select the image to insert it into your slide. As you generate images, you might need to refine your prompt to meet your needs. To do this, edit the text input and choose Create again. In the next lesson, we walk through creating and refining a prompt and selecting a style for your image.

In this demo, you explore improving your prompts and adding a style to your graphics by using Gemini in Google Slides. You learn how to: Refine a prompt to improve the result. Add a style to your prompt to generate images in a particular style. First, create an image by using Gemini in Slides Suppose you're a marketing manager at a dog food business trying to use Gemini to create fun graphics for your team to motivate them during a meeting. Open Slides and open an existing presentation or start a new blank presentation, then select Create image with Duet AI. In the text input, type the prompt. In this case, you can choose: "Dog saying we can do it." Then, click Create. You have now generated multiple images using Duet AI, but these images may not fully suit the use case. You can edit the original prompt to help generate new responses that fit better. Now, refine the prompt. To edit the prompt, click the field that contains your prompt and type the desired changes. Edit the prompt so that it provides more details on your desired visual. Specify the type of dog, and that it's holding a sign with the desired words "We can do it!". This will give Duet AI more context for your needs. The new prompt can be: "A bulldog holding a sign with the text "We can do it!" The new images should now be much closer to your needs. Lastly, pick a style for your images. Perhaps you don't want your presentation visuals to be so photorealistic, and prefer more of a graphical, cartoon look. In addition to the text input, you can also choose to Add a style. This is another input that lets you choose the visual style of the outputs provided by Duet AI. You can add styles such as Photography, Sketch, Vector Art, Watercolor, or more. These styles are then applied to the output visuals. After selecting a style, choose Create to see new images in that style. In this case, you want a less photorealistic look so you can choose Vector art as the style, and then select Create again. With a few refinements and specifications to your prompt, you can get your desired image for your presentation. You can then select the image for it to be added to your slide.
