# [Build Custom Processors with Document AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/686)

**Description:**

Earn a skill badge by completing the Build Custom Processors with Document AI course, where you will learn how to extract data and classify documents by creating custom ML models that are specific to your business needs. This course will give you the chance to learn the foundation skills of building your own processors. You will spend time working with optical character recognition, form parsing, processor creation and uptraining the DocumentAI model.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

* Gain foundation skills in using the Document AI workbench console
* Learn to create custom processors for your document types
* Work with optical character recognition and form parsing to build processors
* Uprain ML models with Document AI to improve document processing accuracy
