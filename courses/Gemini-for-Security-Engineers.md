# [Gemini for Security Engineers](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/886)

**Description:**

In this course, you learn how Gemini, a generative AI-powered collaborator from Google Cloud, helps you secure your cloud environment and resources. You learn how to deploy example workloads into an environment in Google Cloud, identify security misconfigurations with Gemini, and remediate security misconfigurations with Gemini. Using a hands-on lab, you experience how Gemini improves your cloud security posture.

Duet AI was renamed to Gemini, our next-generation model.

**Objectives:**

* Enable Gemini.
* Identify and remediate security misconfigurations with Gemini.

## Gemini for Security Engineers

Learn how to identify and remediate security misconfigurations with help from Gemini.

[MUSIC] This is a security engineer. Let's learn how security engineers can identify and mitigate security threats with Gemini. They need to understand the newest vulnerabilities and find out if they have any mitigations to do. Based on their cloud infrastructure and logging. They need to know what their threat exposure is and are hoping to use Gemini for Google Cloud to help them take corrective action if needed. Lets observe this security engineer and their natural habitat as they use Gemini to simplify the task at hand. First our security engineer wonders what are the latest threats they should be aware of? Let's start with the view of the latest threat intelligence from Mandiant, helpfully gathered all in one place for consumption. Whoa, thousands and thousands of results just for one threat actor. Our engineer doesnt have time to read all that. Luckily they can get a quick summary thanks to the AI helper. Picking one prominent threat the engineer wants to dig deeper, but this is just showing a big mess of metadata which is confusing and overwhelming. They start with the Gemini generated summary on the sidebar to give them a faster way to understand what this threat actor is trying to do and where. The security engineer needs to know if they're vulnerable to any of these attack patterns. Luckily they can do a plain language search in chronicle to find out if any of these attacks are hitting their infrastructure. Well this is both good and bad. The good part is that they've got some results without having to navigate the arcane UDM syntax. The bad part is that it appears that they had some hits, so some crypto mining attacks are going on. Let's explore this further. Once again, we see our security engineer overwhelmed with information. Lots of cases, lots of windows, lots of statistics. Help us Gemini summary you're our only hope. Hooray, it's right here and it shows them exactly what they needed. It's time to act now. They go directly to the security command center for actions to respond to the detected threats. No, they found more mountains of metadata. Luckily they've got Gemini here to summarize and give them a quick guide towards mitigation actions. Summary read and digested it's time for the engineer to unwind with watering their plants. What will you build. [MUSIC]

### Lab - [Navigate Security Decisions with Gemini](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/886/labs/475991)

In this lab, you will learn how to use Gemini, an AI-powered collaborator in Google Cloud, to navigate and understand different areas of security in your environment in Security Command Center.

>> I'm a security engineer working on my company's infrastructure. I need to make sure I stay on top of any issues with our security posture or deployments. Let's see if Gemini for Google Cloud can make that faster and easier. Today I'm digging into our Google Kubernetes engine clusters and looking for configuration errors that could increase our risk. To start, I'll deploy a new cluster and clone a simple web app demo from this GitHub repo that models an online store using microservices. Once thats all set you can see the web app is running and available exposed to the Internet. For this exercise pretend im new at monitoring and securing GKE so I turn to Gemini for some help. I can ask for advice on how to secure microservices running in a GKE cluster and get some helpful options back. I decide that today, I'm going to pursue the first one listed, security command center, sounds authoritative. I'll begin at the overview. Then it's time for more advice from Gemini. After I read through some of the helpful documentation that Gemini gives, it's time to return to sec to check on its findings. I see a bunch of medium severity findings and I'll click into them one at a time. Wow. Gemini is right there with me, helping out with a plain language summary of the various metadata and array of fields. Below. I can repeat this on each of the findings that I want to learn about and check on the summaries plus the recommended mitigations. Now that I know what's wrong with this deployment, I'd like to begin remediation. Gemini pointed me to the network policy and I'll follow its instructions. [MUSIC] First, I'll enable network policy for this cluster. While that's processing time to learn a bit more about what I'm actually doing right now, asking Gemini about network policies in GKE gives me a bunch of helpful info and a sample policy to examine. I'd like to make some policies so I'll ask Gemini for help in understanding my pods better via their labels. Hooray, another helpful command that I can use to learn about my microservices. With all the info I've gotten thanks to Gemini, I can work on fixing my clusters, securing my microservices, and replacing my labels. These tools enabled me to learn more about what Google Cloud can do to help me understand security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Gemini was able to give me cloud shell code as well as helpful summaries speeding up my work.
