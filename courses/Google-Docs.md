person: Hello, and welcome. In this course, we will introduce you to Google Docs, Google's online word processor that's part of Google Workspace. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities, you'll become more confident in using Google Docs. With Google Docs, your documents are stored in the cloud, and you can access them from any computer or device. You create and edit documents right in your web browser. No special software is required. Even better, multiple people can work on a document at the same time, you can see people's changes as they make them, and every change is saved automatically. We encourage you to be signed into Google Workspace throughout the course, not just the activities. You can pause a video lecture or demonstration at any time, and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer On the Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you will use Google Docs to solve a particular business challenge being faced by On the Rise. So let's take a look at the scenario we'll be using as you learn some key features of Google Docs. Kaina Gao is head of global marketing and sales at On the Rise. As a designer and creative visionary, she's always looking for new ideas that she can use to promote the On the Rise brand. Last month, Kaina attended an international marketing conference, where she was intrigued by a session titled The Top Eight Bakery Trends. And during the session, she took many notes in a Microsoft Word document on her tablet. Kaina asks for your help. She is hoping the information she has collected can be converted into On the Rise marketing collateral. However, before this happens, Kaina wants to convert the Word document into a Google Doc and share it with her marketing team. Even though her team is geographically dispersed, she'd like the team to work collaboratively to improve the content, as well as make a number of formatting changes. Okay, ready to get started? Great. Let's begin.

## Introduction to Google Docs

Many of us have worked with word processing tools. In this module we will discuss how Google Docs documents are created and how Google Docs works across other file formats, allowing you to edit and save revisions seamlessly and collaboratively.

Person: Welcome to Module One, Introduction to Google Docs. Many of us have worked with word processing tools. In this module, we will discuss how Google Docs documents are created and how the program works across other file formats, allowing you to edit and save revisions seamlessly and collaboratively. Google Docs is a smart, easy to use, but powerful word processor that's part of Google Workspace. You can create, view and edit your Google Docs documents all with just a web browser. It's also easy to share with anyone and edit in real time with collaborators anywhere in the world. Google Docs can open, edit, and convert Microsoft Word files, and documents can be exported into other formats so you always have access to your documents. There are a few ways to create a new Google Docs document. Go to docs.google.com to view just your documents exclusive of other types of files in Google Drive. Click the Plus icon and choose Create New Document, or if the template gallery is visible, click on the blank thumbnail to create a new document. You can also create a new document while working in an existing document. Just select File, hover over New, and select Document. Perhaps the simplest way to create a new document is to type docs.new into your browser's address bar. If you haven't done so already, go to Google Docs now. Open a new browser tab and visit docs.google.com. Google Docs documents are stored in Google Drive. Google Drive is cloud storage for any file. To create a new document from Google Drive, type drive.google.com in the address bar of your browser to open Google Drive. Then select New and choose Google Docs. The new blank document will open in a new browser tab. From Google Drive, if you hover over the arrow next to Google Docs in the menu, you can also choose to create a new document from a template. A template is a document that's already been formatted for a purpose like a letter, a report, or meeting notes. There are general templates that all Google Docs users have access to, and organizational templates that have been created by people within your specific organization. You can also choose a template for your new document if you're working directly in Google Docs at docs.google.com. If you have created documents in Microsoft Word, you can upload them to Google Drive and edit them with Google Docs. You can choose to keep the documents in Microsoft Word format or convert them to Google Docs documents. Converting them to docs enables the full capabilities of Google Docs. Regardless of how you create your document, as you edit it, your changes are automatically saved with a history of all the changes made by you and any collaborators so you'll never lose a keystroke.

## Compose a Google Doc

After you create a document, you will want to format and add styles so the document meets your needs. In this module we will show you how you can format and name your document and then print it or move it to where you and your team can collaboratively access it. 

### Video - [Compose a Google Doc](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/195/video/528816)

person: Welcome to Module Two, Compose a Google Docs Document. After you create a document, you'll want to format and add styles so the document meets your needs. In this module, we'll show you how you can format and name your document and then print it or move it to where you and your team can collaboratively access it. When you begin editing a document, use the Format Menu or Toolbar to change text size, alignment and more. Select a word, sentence, paragraph, or the entire document, and then apply your desired formatting. In addition to applying bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript and subscript formatting to text, you can increase or decrease font size, and choose from many fonts to personalize your document. Change the font color or the highlight color to emphasize text. Align or indent paragraphs, change line spacing with preset and custom spacing options. Google Docs also supports multiple columns of content and bulleted or numbered lists with many different style options. If you want to reset your choices, choose Clear Formatting to clear any applied text formatting. Google Docs has its own preset styles that can be applied to text. You can customize these if you prefer. To personalize the textiles in your documents, select some text and apply the formatting you require. Then select Format Paragraph Styles. Hover over the style you want to customize and choose Update Style to Match. If you want to retain your custom styles for future documents, select Format Paragraph Styles again, then Options and select Save As My Default Styles. Then to use your own styles later in another document, create a new document and select Format Paragraph Styles. Then select Options and Use My Default Styles. Google Docs defaults to a portrait orientation and letter sized paper with one inch margins all around. Select File and Page Setup to modify these options as well as the page color. Select Set as Default to make the page setup settings apply to any new document you create, or select Okay to save the settings just for your current document. To print a document, select the Print icon in the toolbar, or select File and then Print. Choose a destination printer or save as PDF. Choose which pages to print, the pages per sheet, margins, and whether to include background graphics if there are any. On Windows and Mac, you can open the system dialog for printing to access additional options. To name your document, select Untitled Document at the top and type a name. While you're editing the name, the location of the document in Google Drive will be visible next to it. Select it to move your document to another location in Google Drive. Later if you want to change the location of the file, select the Move icon. Select the star to add your file to the starred label in Google Drive. Select See Document Status to check whether your changes are saved and whether the file is available for offline access. If offline access is not enabled for your Google Drive, you can turn it on from the See Document Status dialog. When offline access is enabled, you can select File and then Make Available Offline for a specific document.

## Enhance your Google Docs

In this module you'll learn how to make the document even more functional by creating a table of contents, adding headers and footers, and inserting links and bookmarks.

narrator: Welcome to Module Three, Enhance your Google Docs Document. So far, you've created a document, added formatting, and moved it to a location where it's easily accessible. In this module, you'll learn how to make the document even more functional by creating a table of contents, adding headers and footers, and inserting links and bookmarks. How often do you need to include graphics in your documents? Well, Google Docs supports the addition of content like images, drawings and charts. Adding content to a document is done via the Insert menu. Select Insert, then choose the type of content you want to insert. Let's take some time to walk through the Insert menu in order to see some of the ways you can enhance your documents. Adding a table of contents to a document is simple. The Table of Contents is automatically generated when you use the title and heading styles in the document. Place the cursor in the document where you want the table of contents to appear. Then choose Insert, Table of Contents. Then choose the table of contents style you want to add to your document. Headers and footers are not visible until they are added to the document. After a header or footer is added, double click the top of the document for headers or at the bottom for footers to add content and change the settings. Both the header and footer can display page numbers.

### Video - [Add links and bookmarks](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/195/video/528822)

- [YouTube: Add links and bookmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7bRsoE7Z6U)

person: Text within the document can be linked to headings and bookmarks within the doc, websites, and files stored in Google Drive. When a website, Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides are linked, document viewers will see a preview of the linked content as long as they have at least viewer permission to see the linked files. To add a hyperlink to specific text, select the text, choose Link from the Insert menu, and then enter your link address. Once created, you can select any link to edit it, copy it or remove it. Bookmarks can be placed within the doc to help readers find a location quickly or move around the document. To add a bookmark, move the cursor to your desired bookmark location. Then, from the Insert menu, select Bookmark to create the bookmark. To link to the bookmark, choose Link from the Insert menu and choose the bookmark from the list.

- [YouTube: Images, tables and drawings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zLru-g0eh8)

person: Images can be added to a document from your computer, from the web, from Google Drive, and more. Place the cursor where you want to insert the image and select Image from the Insert menu. Then choose the location of your image. Search the web opens a Google Images search panel in the document from where you can search by keywords, preview images, and then select one or more images to insert. Choosing Photos opens a search panel of your Google Photos and Albums. Adding by URL inserts an image via the web address of the image. If your device has a camera, a photo can be taken by selecting Camera. After you add an image, you can drag the image to resize it and move it around the document. You can also double click on the image to crop it or click on the image and then choose Image Options to reveal more settings. With Google Docs, you can also create custom tables. From the Insert menu, hover over table and then drag your mouse pointer over the squares in the grid to choose the size of the table. Each square from left to right represents a column. Each square from top to bottom represents a row. After you insert the table into the document, you can edit it by adding or deleting rows and columns, and changing the borders and cell backgrounds, the alignment, and more. Another option is to insert a Google Drawing. You can add an existing drawing from Google Drive, or create a new file directly from your Google Docs documents.

- [YouTube: Insert a linked chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlW7jt4m20c)

person: Adding a chart to a doc from a Google Sheet creates a dynamic connection to the data in the sheet. After you insert the chart, it can be updated with a click when the data in the sheet is modified. From the Insert menu, hover over Chart and select From Sheets. Select the sheet from the search box and then select the chart from the sheet and import. Once the chart has been added to the doc, you can modify its presentation. By default, updates made to the sheet will be linked to the chart in your document, but you can unlike them so any updates made in Google Sheets are not reflected in your document.

## Share your Google Docs

In this module we'll explore how to share a document with the appropriate permissions, manage versions of the document and, if necessary, transfer its ownership. And while there are many reasons to keep the document in the cloud, we'll discuss the options available to download your document.

person: Welcome to Module 4: Share Your Google Docs. One of the great things about Google Docs is that you can collaborate on your document and still maintain version control. In this module, we'll explore how to share a document with the appropriate permissions, manage versions of the document, and, if necessary, transfer its ownership. And while there are many reasons to keep the document in the cloud, we'll discuss the options available for downloading your document. Now, what do you want to do when you finished creating your doc? Share it, of course! Google Workspace is known for collaboration. In this module, you'll see the power of collaboration. Google Docs documents are easy to share. Just select Share to get started. The sharing window will appear so you can choose who can access the document. To quickly share a document with someone, type their name or email address in the Add People in Groups box. You can add more than one person, and Google Groups can even be added to share with many people at once. When you create a document, you are the owner. As the owner, you can change the contents of the document, add collaborators, download it, print it, copy it, transfer ownership to another collaborator, and delete it. You grant others access to your document by assigning them a collaborator role. Collaborators can be editors, commenters or viewers. Permissions are actions that can be performed by an individual according to their assigned role. Editors can change the content of the document, download it, print it, and copy it, but they cannot transfer ownership or delete it. Depending on the document settings, editors may be able to change permissions when you share the document with others. Commenters can view the contents of the document but cannot change it. They can add comments and assign tasks. Although a commenter cannot change a document, they can also suggest changes that can only be accepted by an editor or the owner. When you are added as a viewer, the document is in View Mode for you. You cannot change the content of the document, but you can download it, print it, or copy it as long as the owner allows it. You can also request edit access from the owner by clicking the Request Edit Access button. Sharing permissions, including removing collaborators entirely or transferring ownership of the document to another editor, can be changed at any time. Select Share to view your collaborators and their permissions. Selecting the Share with People settings gear icon exposes two additional options which are enabled by default. An editor's ability to share the document can be removed. Also, download, print, and copy options can be removed from viewers and commenters. You can also set an expiration date for any viewer or commenter. After that date has passed, that collaborator will no longer have access to the document. This might be useful if, for example, you have asked for feedback, but you require feedback by a certain date. Google Docs supports another mode: Suggesting. When a collaborator changes to this mode, edits becomes suggestions that can later be accepted or rejected by any editor. Suggestions are outlined in green in the document and are linked to a comment card on the right side of the document that shows what the change is-- so add, delete, or replace-- who made it, and when it was made. Editors and commenters can reply to the suggestions. To see all of the suggested edits in a document, select Tools and Review Suggested Edits. A card will appear below the Mode button in the document with the navigation tools for suggested edits. Use the Up and Down arrows to move forward or backward in the document to the edits. You can select Accept All or Reject All. And you can also preview what the document will look like if you choose either option. You can also share a document using a link. Links can be shared via email, on a website, or any number of other ways. Select Share, and then select Copy Link to copy the link to your device's clipboard. By default, the link sharing scope for a document is restricted, which allows access to only those people who have been explicitly granted permission. You can change the scope of the link to share the document with everyone in your organization or with anyone who has the link. You should also choose viewer, commenter, or editor permissions at this time. Use care when sharing a document in this way; anyone who has the link can share it with other people. The document owner can assign ownership to any collaborator who has edit access. To change ownership, select Share to open the sharing window. Select the new owner and select editor next to that person's name. Select Transfer Ownership, and then select Share. When you transfer ownership of the document, you will become an editor. But the new owner can remove you as a collaborator. Google Docs keeps track of all the changes made to the document by all of the editors. To view the history of a document, select File, hover over Version History, and select See Version History. The versions browser will appear. Versions are listed chronologically from newest to oldest in a panel on the right side of the screen. Select a date to expand a more granular view of the edits. Select a version to see what the change was and who made it. Each editor and their edits will be represented by a specific color. Select more options to make a copy of the document at that point in time, or to create a named version. Named versions are a useful way of identifying the state of the document at a specific point in time. For example, you may have been collaborating on a project proposal and are now ready for it to go through an approval workflow. But you want to be able to safely revert to the version that existed just before entering the approval flow. In this case, you can name the version pending approval and then add the approvers as collaborators. Later, you can go back and see the document as it was when it entered the approval cycle. If you create named versions, you can enable the Only Show Named Version slider to filter out any versions that are not named. At any time, you can select an edit and select Restore This Version to return the document to that state. Editors of a document can access the activity dashboard to see viewers, comments, and sharing history. Each document has its own dashboard accessible by clicking the Activity Dashboard icon in the title bar of the page. The Viewers tab shows viewer activity for the document. Next to each viewer's name, the date of the last time they have viewed the doc will appear along with a checkbox to select them for sending an email. An info button may appear next to the Date column on the row for a viewer. This indicates that the viewer history is not available for this person because they have opted out of having their activity tracked. The Viewer Trend tab shows graphs of unique viewers over time. Click the drop down to change the view timeframe, or drag the bar on the timeline to change to a custom timeframe. The Common Trend tab will show comment activity over time. The Sharing History tab shows the number of people that the doc is shared with, with a link to manage settings which, if clicked, will open up the Sharing card. A list of sharing activity shows who was added to the doc as a collaborator, which editor added them, when they were added, and their role as editor, commenter, or viewer. The Privacy Settings tab allows you to manage your activity history. By default, your view history is visible to document editors and owners. From here, you can disable your view activity collection across all files you access or for just the current document. If you choose to hide your view history, you can still see view history on your document, but your views will not be included.

person: A document can be made public by publishing it to the web. Select File and then Publish to the Web, to choose your options for making the document public. Documents can be published as a link or embedded in a web page. You can choose whether your colleagues must be signed in to their Google Workspace account to view the document, or whether it can be viewed anonymously. You can also choose whether you want the document to be republished automatically after a content change. Google Docs documents can be downloaded to your computer for editing in other apps or for sharing with people. Select File, hover over Download, and choose a format to download the document. The supported formats include Microsoft Word, Open Document, Rich Text, and PDF. These formats may not be viewable or editable on your device, and downloaded files are no longer subject to the permissions for viewing and editing that were set in Google Docs.

person: Welcome to Module 5: Collaborate in Google Docs. Often when collaborating with others on a document, you'll want to leave comments. In this module, we'll discuss how to use comments effectively to support the development of a document. You'll learn how to add comments to a document, assign someone to an action item, resolve a comment, and view the comment history. You'll also learn how Google Docs' comments integrate with Gmail. When collaborating on a document, editors and commenters can use comments for discussions and action items. Comments appear in cards on the right side of the document. To add a new comment, select any contents in the document. So a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, image, chart, et cetera. Select the add a comment icon that appears on the right edge of the document to add your comment. Type your comment in the text box and select comment to add it or cancel to discard the comment. You can also add a comment from the insert menu and by clicking the add comment icon from the toolbar. To reply to an existing comment, select the comment card and type in the reply box. When you have a comment card selected, the content connected to the comment will appear with a yellow background in the document until the comment is resolved or deleted. You might want to send a comment to a specific person. To do this, mention a person in a comment by typing the plus character or the at character and then start typing their name or email address. Google will make suggestions for you as you type. Select comment to send them a message and add them to the discussion. If they don't have access to the document, a prompt will appear where you can choose the sharing permission to grant them, comment or edit. Remember, you can also turn link sharing on so that anyone with the link to the document can comment. When you mention a person in a comment, a checkbox will appear to allow you to assign the comment to them. Checking the box will notify the person and make them responsible for marking it as done. The person assigned can reply to the comment or select the checkmark in the comment card to mark it as done and hide the discussion. Select more options to edit a comment or delete it. The link to this comment option generates a link that you can copy and send to a collaborator so they can go directly to the comment in your document. As comments are added, edited, and resolved, you can view them all by selecting open comment history next to the share button. From the comment history, you can view, edit, delete, resolve, link to, and reopen comments. Selecting any of the comment cards in the history will move you to the place in the dock where the comment was added.

person: To manage notifications for comments in a document, open the comment history and select notifications. You can choose to receive notifications for all comments or only your comments or you can disable comments completely. When you and a collaborator are simultaneously editing a document, their Google account profile photo or first initial will appear in the upper right hand corner to the left of the Share and Comment history buttons. To chat with them in real time, select Show chat to open the chat panel in the document and type in the chat box. All collaborators will be able to see the chat.

Welcome to module six, Google Docs tools. In this module, we'll look at more features that Google Docs has to offer. We'll take some time to understand how you can set your preferences to increase your productivity. You will learn how to translate content and to ensure the document is accessible to your audience. You will also learn how to compare documents to quickly identify differences. Google Docs has several features to make your content creating and editing more efficient. Select Tools to open the menu, then select Preferences to view these features. Google Docs can automatically capitalize words, detect links and lists, and correct spelling. Google Docs can also automatically Suggest action items. This happens if Docs detects a phrase that indicates a task to Assign, for example, if you enter "To do: Anthony to add a new discussion question” into a document. The Smart Compose feature uses artificial intelligence to suggest words as you type. Substitutions will replace typed characters with symbols like typing the letter C in parentheses that will insert the copyright symbol. These substitutions happen automatically. Use this feature to create shortcuts of just two or three characters to automatically expand the words or phrases you frequently type, for example, words such as your organization's name, or a phrase that is common to the content you create. Take some time to explore these options for yourself.
