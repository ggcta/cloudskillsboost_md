# [Google Cloud Storage and Containers for Azure Professionals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/521)

**Description:**

This is the third course of a four-course series for cloud architects and engineers with existing Azure knowledge. It compares Google Cloud and Azure solutions and guides professionals on their use.

This course focuses on storage options and containers in Google Cloud. The learners apply the knowledge of storage and containers in Azure to explore how they differ from Google Cloud. Learners get hands-on practice building and managing Google Cloud resources.

**Objectives:**

* Create and configure Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.
* Compare Cloud SQL to Azure SQL.
* Compare Google Cloudâ€™s data lake options with Azure.
* Explain how Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) differs from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
* Provision a Kubernetes cluster by using GKE.

## Storage in Google Cloud

In this module, you will learn about core storage options in Google Cloud and the use cases for each. You will examine the similarities and differences between Azure Blob Storage and Cloud Storage, Azure SQL and Cloud SQL, and the data lake services in both platforms.

## Containers in Google Cloud

In this module, you will learn how Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Anthos let you orchestrate containers in Google Cloud and in hybrid or multi-cloud environments. You will examine key concepts related to containers and Kubernetes, and explore concepts specific to GKE and the similarities and differences with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Additionally, you will examine how to create and update Deployments to support your workloads in GKE. You will also learn about the purpose of Anthos and how it provides consistent container orchestration across GKE and on-premises environments.
