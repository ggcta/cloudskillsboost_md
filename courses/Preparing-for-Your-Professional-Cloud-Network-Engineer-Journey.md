Throughout this course, you'll be pointed to specific resources and documentation that can help you fill the gaps you identify through the diagnostic questions. Let's go over the types of resources you may want to include in your study plan. Google provides resources to help you develop your skills and experience with Google Cloud solutions. The learning path for this certification includes in-person or online courses, online practice labs and skill badges, and practice questions. The courses recommended for the Professional Cloud Network Engineer certification include Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure, Networking in Google Cloud, and Logging, Monitoring and Observability in Google Cloud. You'll learn more about how these courses relate to the sections of the exam guide as you complete the modules in this course. Keep in mind that Networking in Google Cloud is available in an on-demand format as a six-course series. You should take all six courses: Fundamentals, Routing and Addressing, Network Architecture, Network Security, Load Balancing, and Hybrid and Multicloud for equivalent content to the 3-day instructor led course. The same applies to Logging, Monitoring, and Observability in Google Cloud. You should take both courses, Logging and Monitoring in Google Cloud and Observability in Google Cloud for equivalent content to the 2-day instructor led course. Skill badges provide hands-on experience working in Google Cloud. Skill badges are learning paths made up of labs that give you hands-on practice with Google Cloud services or solutions. Pass the challenge lab at the end, and you'll receive a shareable credential that recognizes your ability to solve real-world problems with your cloud knowledge. As we review the diagnostic questions in this course, you'll also get recommendations for skill badges to include in your study plan. Sample questions are another resource you can use to prepare. The diagnostic questions in this course are designed to help you identify your knowledge gaps. On the certification page, Google provides a different set of sample questions that can help you familiarize yourself with the format of the exam questions. Once you complete the question set, you will receive feedback describing the rationale for the correct answers. The sample questions provide a good opportunity to practice taking the type of scenario-based, application-level questions on the exam. The exam questions present you with a scenario, explain the goal or what you're trying to achieve, and ask you what you would do in this situation. Remember these tips for multiple choice questions. Read the question stem carefully. Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Try to anticipate the correct answer before looking at the options. You should be able to come up with the correct answer just from reading the question stem. You may find that more than one answer may be possible on multiple choice tests. Take questions at face value. If certain details are omitted, then they are unlikely to contribute to the selection of the best answer. Pay attention to qualifiers such as ‘usually’, ‘all’, ‘never’, ‘none’, and keywords like ‘the best’, ‘the least’, ‘except’. Google also supplies official public documentation for its products and services. This documentation can be found at the URL noted on the screen. In each of the following modules, you'll learn about specific documentation resources to help you study that section in preparation for the exam.

Let's start by exploring the breadth of considerations involved in the design of a Google Cloud network, and the role of the Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal Bank. Cymbal Bank plans to extend its on-premises data center infrastructure to connect into Google Cloud to support a hybrid cloud model. As a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, you play an integral role in designing and planning the network infrastructure. Cymbal Bank plans to continue deploying some workloads in your on-premises data center environments various locations, while moving others to Google Cloud for deployment into cloud virtual infrastructure. You need to design a hybrid cloud environment to connect on-premises, branch, office, and data center environments to the new cloud environment. These workloads, running on-premises and in the cloud, will communicate and exchange significant amounts of data, both for real-time transactional workloads as well as streaming or batch analytics workloads. Your network design will require secure high bandwidth, low latency communication, connecting Cymbal Bank’s, physical and virtual data center networks with the virtual private cloud (VPC) networks in Google Cloud. To give you a better understanding of the types of considerations involved in designing and planning the network, let's review Cymbal Bank’s existing infrastructure and the changes you will make with the upcoming cloud migration. Cymbal Bank has data centers in New York, London, and Singapore. It also has branches and offices distributed across the U.S., western Europe, and southeast Asia. Cymbal Bank deploys a mixture of monolithic and some microservices-based workloads, including both transactional and analytical workloads. Most workloads reside in data centers, but some run in branch and office environments. You want to deploy Google Cloud resources close to your data centers. Cymbal Bank plans to use Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Dataproc, and BigQuery in its cloud solutions. The closest Google Cloud regions to Cymbal Bank’s data centers all support these required features. You also decide to utilize other nearby regions in Iowa, Belgium, and Jakarta as secondary deployment locations. This will provide higher capacity and lower latency for users outside the primary regions. These secondary regions will also provide fallback in case of regional cloud failures in the primary regions. The deployments will utilize at least two zones in each region to provide higher availability. As a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, your starting task is to design the network architecture for Cymbal Bank. You determine that Cymbal Bank will have four primary shared VPC networks in four different host projects corresponding to development, test, staging, and production environments. Each VPC will have subnets in the six primary and secondary regions. You will configure appropriate routes and firewall rules for the expected traffic profiles. Cymbal Bank will have a large number of service projects using those four shared VPCs. Service projects will be deployed as quadruplets with development, testing, staging, and production projects provided per team, department, or product. Each component service project connects to its respective host project. You will assign access to network resources using IAM predefined roles: Shared VPC Admin, Network Admin, Security Admin, and Network User roles. You decide that Cymbal Bank will also deploy standalone VPC networks for ephemeral analytics workloads. You will use VPC peering to connect them to the shared VPC networks as needed. You decide to use Dedicated Interconnect connections to Google Cloud colocation facilities. You will also use Layer 2 and 3 Partner Interconnect connections. These connections will have a mix of regular and high availability configurations. Cymbal Bank will also utilize both Classic and HA Cloud VPN with a mix of static and dynamic routing. You will use Cloud Router for private connectivity between Google Cloud and the satellite branches and offices. You plan to use Cloud Load Balancing with global external and regional internal Application Load Balancers. This configuration will serve static and dynamic content with low latency. You will use Cloud CDN to provide caching of static resources to increase capacity and reduce latency. Cloud CDN improves serving capacity because most users are served resource requests from edge locations, rather than having the requests enter the VPC and be served from the origin. Cymbal Bank will use Google Cloud Armor to provide DDoS and other attack protections to their public endpoints, which will all be exposed via Cloud Load Balancing. They will use Cloud NAT to provide internet access to resources with no public or external IP address. You'll use Network Intelligence features for monitoring, troubleshooting, and debugging. Network Topology lets you visualize VPCs, interconnects, and VPN links and associated metrics. Connectivity Tests lets you troubleshoot connectivity issues. Performance Dashboard provides high-level interzone metrics. Firewall Insights lets you troubleshoot firewall traffic control. Google Cloud Observability lets you perform general network monitoring and debugging using VPC Flow Logs and firewall logs. You'll use it for incident detection and response, latency tracking, network traffic flow or firewall debugging, and forensics. Logs may also be exported to Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, or BigQuery for integration with external systems, long-term storage, and/or SQL analysis. Some of Cymbal Bank’s legacy monoliths cannot, or will not, be converted to microservices. These will be deployed into regional managed instance groups of VMs. Cymbal Bank will deploy all its microservices to GKE. Some existing monoliths will be converted to microservices that will also be deployed into GKE. You decide to utilize private VPC-native GKE clusters in standard mode to ensure security and maximum infrastructure flexibility. Learning about Cymbal Bank’s network design should give you a sense of the scope of considerations involved in planning a Google Cloud network. This is a vital part of your role as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, so let's explore further with diagnostic questions focusing on this area.

- [YouTube: Considerations for Cymbal Bank’s VPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDloqYrHwXs)

Let's start by exploring the breadth of considerations involved as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal Bank, tasked with implementing a VPC. In module one, you learned about the Professional Cloud Network Engineer's role in Cymbal Bank's Google Cloud network design. Now, you must start implementing this design. You need to decide on a private IP address plan to integrate Cymbal Bank's VPCs and let them communicate with the on-premises infrastructure. This includes devising an IP plan for Cymbal Bank's GKE clusters. You should also assign IP address ranges to subnets and create those subnets in the appropriate regions. Your implementation should consider where the various managed instance groups and GKE clusters will reside. You complete the implementation of Cymbal Bank's VPC with routing rules to provide the communication paths between the on-premises resources and VPCs. You also set firewall rules that restrict traffic flow on the VPCs to only the sources, destinations, ports, and protocols required for the workload traffic. As a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, you begin with implementing an IP addressing plan for Cymbal Bank's Google Cloud VPCs. For its existing on-premises solutions, Cymbal Bank uses RFC 1918 IP blocks for internal networking. The three data centers use the 172.28.0.0/14, 172.24.0.0/14, and 172.20.0.0/14 blocks. Each branch reuses the 192.168.0.0/16 block. Because it will not overlap with the on-premises RFC 1918 usage, you decide to use the 10.0.0.0/8 block for all Cymbal Bank’s Google Cloud VPC IP addressing. You assign subnet primary and secondary ranges for the four shared VPCs from the 10.128.0.0/9 block, reusing that block for each shared VPC. The overlap among shared VPCs is not a concern because they are separate environments and should not communicate using internal IP addresses. You give access to specific subnets in a shared VPC to each team that uses the service project. You use the 10.0.0.0/9 block for standalone VPCs that host ephemeral analytics or ML workloads. These may be peered to the shared VPCs whenever you require internal IP address communication. You give access to several subnets in different regions to each team. Teams will deploy their managed instance group of VMs or Kubernetes Engine clusters in the subnets for their service project. You choose a primary IP address range that is just large enough to support the current expected number of VM instances, or Google Kubernetes Engine nodes. As workload needs change and more VM instances or nodes are required, you can expand the primary ranges without disruption of workloads. You select secondary ranges based on the expected number of pods and services for GKE clusters. All GKE clusters will be private clusters deployed in VPC-native mode. Although secondary ranges can be deleted and recreated as the pod and service accounts change, this requires deletion and recreation of the cluster, which could cause disruption to workloads. When VPC networks are created, a set of default routes is also created. For every subnet that routes traffic to an associated subnet, a default route is created for each primary range and each secondary range. Also, an internet gateway route (0.0.0.0/0) is created that routes all traffic not matching any subnet primary or secondary range to the internet. Cloud Router can automatically add dynamic routes based on BGP communication with on-premises VPN gateways, routers across Cloud VPN, or Interconnect links. This allows traffic to be routed between VPCs and on-premises networks. You add custom routes for specialized routing scenarios, applying some routes strictly to specific VMs as required. Custom routes let you route through NAT/Proxy, WAF or traffic scanning, an internal load balancer, or a VPN gateway. When peering standalone VPCs to the shared VPC, you decide whether to exchange custom and dynamic routes across the peering link. You've now defined the IP plan, VPC networks and subnets, and routing rules for Cymbal Bank’s network. Next, you need to implement firewall rules that only allow traffic required for the operation and maintenance of Cymbal Bank’s workloads. The default behavior of VPCs is to allow any requests sent from resources, but to block any request arriving at resources. These are referred to as the implicit ‘deny all ingress’ and ‘allow all egress’ rules. They can be overridden by higher-priority firewall rules specified for the VPC. Cymbal Bank has identified the ports and protocols used for workload, operational, and maintenance traffic. You create ingress and egress allow and deny firewall rules to ensure that valid traffic can flow and invalid traffic is blocked. You simplify the design and implementation of rules by setting priority values and having the rules applied in priority order. The rules can also be applied generally to all resources in the VPC, or selectively to only certain resources by network tag or workload service account. You opt to use workload service accounts and have firewall rules applied to ensure that workloads only communicate with other valid workloads using intended ports and protocols. Cymbal Bank will use the same firewall rules across all their shared VPC host projects. You leverage hierarchical firewall rules and bind the rules at the Organization or Folder level to avoid duplication of rules across all four projects. After configuring the firewall rules, you run system testing on Cymbal Bank’s workloads to determine whether they function normally. As a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, you monitor and troubleshoot the firewall configuration using firewall logs and insights, and fix any detected problems. Remember that Cymbal Bank will only run private VPC-native Kubernetes Engine clusters. Private clusters include four control plane template options, which are the combinations of public access enabled or disabled, and authorized networks enabled or disabled. These options determine where the control plane can be accessed from. You decide to configure your clusters with public access enabled and authorized networks enabled. This configuration enables access to the control plane from other locations, in addition to the on-premises private network and the VPCs. This decision lets administrators administer the cluster from the Cloud Shell or other locations that can only reach the cluster publicly. You will only add authorized networks on a temporary basis, and update the cluster to add or remove authorized networks as needed. You want Cymbal Bank's GKE workloads to stay fully portable and maintain the same in-cluster firewalling when deployed in non-Google Cloud environments. You leave intra-node visibility disabled and use built-in network policies for in-cluster firewalling. You want Cymbal Bank to rely on Network Connectivity Center to streamline its network operations and ensure secure, reliable connectivity for its branches and services. Cymbal Bank will use Network Connectivity Center to: Centrally manage its VPC networks. Network Connectivity Center will provide Cymbal Bank with a single pane of glass to manage its complex network infrastructure. This centralized approach simplifies network management, improves visibility, and reduces operational overhead. Secure branch office connectivity. Cymbal Bank will use Network Connectivity Center to establish secure VPN connections between its branches and its central Google Cloud environment. This approach ensures that sensitive customer data remains protected while enabling seamless communication and access to critical resources. Scale its VPC network infrastructure. As Cymbal Bank expands its operations and opens new branches, Network Connectivity Center will enable it to scale its network infrastructure effortlessly. New connections can be provisioned quickly and efficiently, ensuring minimal disruption and maintaining high performance. By leveraging Network Connectivity Center, Cymbal Bank will achieve a more agile, secure, and scalable network environment, empowering it to deliver exceptional financial services to its customers.

## Configuring managed network services

In this module, you review Cymbal Bank's functional requirements, regarding network services, including load balancing, Cloud CDN, Google Cloud Armor, Cloud NAT, Cloud DNS, and packet mirroring. You will edit your study plan to note the skills that you must develop to design and implement these services.

Welcome to Module 3: Configuring managed network services. In this module we explore the scope of tasks involved in configuring network services for Cymbal, which corresponds to the third section of the Professional Cloud Network Engineer Exam guide. We'll start by examining some considerations with our example at Cymbal. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through ten diagnostic questions. Then we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

### Video - [Considerations for Cymbal Bank’s VPC](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/383/video/509723)

- [YouTube: Considerations for Cymbal Bank’s VPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wLT7f72_O8)

Let's start by examining how a Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal would configure network services for Cymbal and the types of considerations involved. The next step in the network design and implementation for Cymbal Bank is to configure the network services you will use. Cymbal Bank will have many user-facing applications deployed to Google Cloud. Users will interact with them via web or mobile apps. You want to provide these applications with optimal performance for users distributed over large geographies. To provide the lowest possible latency with the highest capacity and highest availability, you deploy the applications behind Application Load Balancers. The load balancers provide both security and performance by protecting against layer 3 and 4 attacks. To provide additional layer 7 protection, you also use configurable security policies in Google Cloud Armor. To further reduce latency and increase capacity for serving static resources, you leverage Google's Cloud CDN, to catch all those static assets in all appropriate Google Cloud edge locations. You use Cloud DNS to map Cymbal Bank's domain names to the load balancer IP addresses. You also protect compute resources from the internet by ensuring that they only have private internal IP addresses, and by setting firewall rules to allow access only from the load balancers. Many of these private compute resources will still require outbound internet access to make requests to partner APIs, and that capability will be provided by Cloud NAT. Finally, to understand network performance in more detail and to provide for real-time scanning of network traffic, you leverage VMs with multiple network interfaces and packet mirroring. Each global external Application Load Balancer can have a single anycast IP address, or a single IPv4 address and a single IPv6 address, that can be used by users around the world. It automatically routes to the backend service that is closest to the user. Cymbal Bank will deploy at least two target proxies and URL maps per Application Load Balancer. The HTTP target proxy redirects to HTTPS. The HTTPS target proxy uses the URL map to direct static resource requests to a backend bucket and dynamic requests to one of several backend services. Some backend services can be connected to more powerful backends with more CPU, more RAM, or GPUs and TPUs, to serve requests that require more processing power, such as machine learning inference at /api/ml or video or graphics rendering at /api/video or /api/graphics. Other backends can be less powerful for basic CRUD-type REST APIs connected to a DB, such as /api/db. Different hosts or paths in the request indicate which backend service should be used for that request. This is known as content-based load balancing and will be used by Cymbal Bank. Each backend connected to a backend service can also autoscale to provide high capacity in a cost-effective fashion by scaling the compute resources up or down based on demand. Cymbal Bank will also use other protocols in their web and mobile apps to improve performance. You leverage WebSockets and gRPC for 2-way communication in chat interfaces. You leverage HTTP/3 (running over QUIC) where the best possible communication performance is required. You run these protocols through the Google Cloud global external Application Load Balancer, and can add or update target proxies to support them. As a Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal Bank, you also need to choose and configure the right load balancers for other scenarios. For load balancing private internal requests, you would use either the internal regional Application Load Balancer or the internal regional Network Load Balancer. These can load balance between tiers of an N-tier architecture or between microservices in a microservices architecture. The internal Application Load Balancer can provide full layer 7 capabilities, such as content-based load balancing. The internal Network Load Balancer can support other non-HTTP based protocols and provide lower latency because it is a passthrough load balancer. Cymbal Bank will primarily be using protocols in the HTTP family. However, there are some scenarios where you deal with other protocols. External proxy Network Load Balancers can provide global load balancing with anycast IP. They can also support IPv6, such as the global external Application Load Balancer. They are intended for non-HTTP protocols running over TCP or TLS. You can use regional external Network Load Balancers for minimum latency passthrough or UDP-based protocols such as RTP. Cymbal Bank expects attacks against any endpoints that are accessible by the public internet. You want to provide as much protection as possible. Google Cloud Armor gives you a configurable managed service that is integrated with the Application Load Balancer. Google Cloud Armor protects against SQL injection, XSS injection, and similar attacks. You can also configure it to filter traffic based on request properties. Traffic through Google Cloud Armor can also be throttled with configurable rate limits or challenged with reCAPTCHA for bot management, or to further protect against DDoS. Cymbal Bank will use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache static resources at many edge locations worldwide to offload those requests from the origin. Using a CDN dramatically increases capacity and also serves requests with much lower latency from the nearest edge location to the user. Finally, a CDN protects static resources from DDoS attacks because the massively distributed cache is designed to support worldwide user request rates far beyond the levels seen in DDoS attacks. You decide to use a CDN to serve a number of static resources, including Cymbal’s website and web application files, such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and photos and other images, video, logos and documents. Google Cloud integrates with many popular CDN providers. You decide to use Cloud CDN, which offers best-in-class performance, ease-of-use, and tight integration with Application Load Balancers. Cloud CDN supports standard cache control headers, customizable cache keys, configurable TTL overrides, cache invalidation, and signed URLs and cookies for authorization - among many other features. Cymbal can also use Cloud CDN to cache on-premises or other cloud origin static resources. These sources can also be placed behind the Application Load Balancer, so that they share a common IP address and domain name and support offload to Google Cloud, or vice versa. You want to continue to use Cymbal Bank's existing on-premises private DNS. You create a hybrid DNS system using Cloud DNS to provide private DNS for Cymbal Bank’s Google Cloud resources. The performance and ease-of-use then leads Cymbal Bank to also migrate the public DNS over to Google Cloud. The migration process is exceedingly simple, and Cymbal Bank completes the migration with a move to Google Domains as its domain registrar. You map Cymbal Bank's global Application Load Balancer IP addresses to the public domain names. With Cloud DNS, you quickly and simply configure private DNS across Cymbal’s shared and standalone VPCs. You integrate this with Cymbal’s on-premises DNS into a hybrid DNS via forwarding zones, peering zones, and inbound and outbound DNS server policies. To maintain maximum security, Cymbal Bank will not allow any resources with external IP addresses to be used in Google Cloud aside from Google managed services such as global external Application Load Balancers. However, Cymbal Bank has resources such as VMs that need to make requests to the internet to call partner or other APIs, or to download software. Cloud NAT provides secure internet-bound requests using managed external IP addresses. You define a small pool of external IP addresses, and Cloud NAT allows this pool to be used efficiently among a large number of private VMs, making periodic internet connections and requests by enabling static or dynamic port allocation and configurable port re-use timeouts. You distribute the pool of external IP addresses among a set of Cloud NAT gateways and bind these managed gateways to their VMs by assigning subnet ranges. When VMs with internal IP addresses (either primary or alias IP) in these ranges make requests, they use the associated Cloud NAT gateway. For Cymbal Bank's most sensitive systems, you set aside isolated internal VPCs with extra control on the network traffic in or out. These most trusted VPCs will be separated from all other VPCs, and will only allow traffic that has been scanned and filtered. To enable this controlled communication, Cymbal Bank uses VMs that run scanning and filtering software with multiple network interfaces. One of those network interfaces connects to the most trusted VPC, and the other interfaces connect to the other, less trusted VPCs. Cymbal Bank will also do periodic security, forensic, and performance analysis of traffic on the less trusted VPCs, which requires packet captures. You will use packet mirroring to efficiently collect these packet captures for real-time or batch analysis. As we just covered, as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer, you have a lot to consider when configuring network services for Cymbal Bank. As you prepare for the exam, you should develop a solid understanding of the different aspects.

In this module, you'll continue to examine the Professional Cloud Network Engineer's role at Cymbal Bank, this time focusing on tasks and considerations involved in implementing hybrid interconnectivity. This corresponds to the fourth section of the Professional Cloud Network Engineer Exam Guide. As in previous modules, we'll start by exploring the Cymbal Bank scenario. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through 10 diagnostic questions. Then, we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

- [YouTube: Configuring network services for Cymbal Bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vg0H5kGgj8)

Let's go over how you would implement hybrid connectivity as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal Bank. In module 3, you explored how a Professional Cloud Network Engineer would configure Cymbal Bank's network services. This module examines the considerations involved in implementing hybrid connectivity, including configuring Google Cloud Interconnect, site-to-site IPsec VPN, and Cloud Router. You decide to use Dedicated Interconnect connections to Google Cloud co-location facilities. You will also use layer 2 and 3 Partner Interconnect connections. These connections will have a mix of regular and high availability configurations. They will also utilize both Classic and HA Cloud VPN with a mix of static and dynamic routing with a Cloud Router for private connectivity between Google Cloud and the satellite branches and offices. Cymbal Bank will use Dedicated Interconnect connections to connect their most critical data center workloads to the nearest Google Cloud region. Dedicated Interconnect can provide the highest bandwidth and lowest latency connectivity, and Cymbal Bank's data center is sufficiently close to a Google Cloud co-location facility to make it cost-effective. Cymbal Bank will create a configuration with 99.9% availability. This configuration will also utilize Partner Interconnect and Cloud VPN links in other locations that can serve as alternative routes, if the Dedicated Interconnect link is temporarily down. The implementation for Dedicated Interconnect involves installing a router in a Google Cloud co-location facility, as well as configuration and connection in that facility to a Google Cloud edge router. You will also need to configure the connections, VLAN attachments, and Cloud Routers in the connected Google Cloud projects and VPCs. Some data centers are not close enough to a Google co-location facility to cost-effectively use Dedicated Interconnect. Cymbal Bank will use Partner Interconnect to connect these data centers to the nearest Google Cloud region. Partner Interconnect bandwidths and latencies can vary by partner, but some partners can offer performance that approaches that provided by Dedicated Interconnect. Partners may provide layer 2 and/or layer 3 connectivity, which have similar configuration. For layer 3, the BGP configuration is performed in the partner router, and not in the on-premises router. Cymbal Bank will utilize both approaches in different locations with different partners, based on the capabilities of the partner in those locations. You will create configurations with 99.9% availability by utilizing other Partner and Dedicated Interconnect and Cloud VPN links in other locations that can serve as alternative routes if the Partner Interconnect link is temporarily down. The implementation for Partner Interconnect involves establishing layer 2 or 3 connectivity to a Google Cloud partner. It also involves configuring of the connections, VLAN attachments, and Cloud Routers in connected Google Cloud projects and VPCs. Cymbal Bank will utilize Google Cloud VPN: HA connections to connect satellite offices or branches to Google Cloud when the office or branch VPN gateway in those locations supports BGP. Cloud VPN HA can provide 99.99% availability when configured with two or four VPN tunnels. It only supports dynamic routing with BGP, and the Cloud Router can only be used with on-premises VPN gateways that also support BGP. Cloud VPN provides 1.5 to 3 Gbps per tunnel with standard internet latency. It is suitable for connecting hybrid workloads that don't require the low latencies and high bandwidth offered by Interconnect. It also can be much faster to set up and less expensive to operate, compared to Interconnect. When the VPN gateway in satellite offices or branches does not support BGP, Cymbal Bank will utilize Cloud VPN Classic. This does not provide the 99.99% availability that can be achieved with Cloud VPN HA, but can offer 99.9% availability, and can be used with static routing. Cloud VPN Classic provides the same bandwidth and latency per tunnel as Cloud VPN HA; however, Cloud VPN HA is the recommended approach when the on-premises peer VPN gateway can support BGP. Cymbal Bank will utilize Cloud Routers to provide dynamic routing via BGP for their interconnecting Cloud VPN HA connections. You will configure the Cloud Routers with the default subnet advertisement mode. You also set your VPC's dynamic routing mode to global so that all subnets and all regions are advertised by each Cloud Router. Any subnet can be reached by any of the VPN or Interconnect links. This ensures connectivity, even when there are simultaneous connection failures, as long as one of the VPN or Interconnect links for the VPC is available. Network Connectivity Center lets you create VPC spokes to connect VPC networks together for full mesh connectivity. It also includes the Router Appliance feature, which lets you use a third-party network virtual appliance to establish site-to-site or site-to-cloud connectivity. Cymbal Bank will utilize Network Connectivity Center to use Google's network as part of a wide area network, including external sites using site-to-site data transfer. After completing the required configuration, you will be able to move data between the different sites. Data transfer provides IPv4 connectivity between external networks using a Google Cloud VPC network and hybrid spokes. You can transfer data between multiple on-premises networks or to other cloud networks. You can create spokes that rely on connectivity resources such as Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect, Router Appliance, and Cross-Cloud Interconnect.

Welcome to Module 5: Managing, monitoring and troubleshooting network operations. In this module, you'll learn about the final area of the Professional Cloud Network Engineer’s role at Cymbal Bank. Once the network has been configured, as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer you play an integral role in ensuring the effectiveness of ongoing network operations. This corresponds to the fifth and final section of the Professional Cloud Network Engineer Exam Guide. As in previous modules, we'll begin by exploring what this aspect of your role looks like at Cymbal Bank. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through eight diagnostic questions. Then we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

### Video - [Module scenario](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/383/video/509737)

- [YouTube: Module scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoGg0Q2kk2o)

Let's explore how a Professional Cloud Network Engineer at Cymbal manages, monitors, and optimizes network operations at Cymbal Bank. Now that Cymbal Bank has completed the implementation of its hybrid network, your role as a Professional Cloud Network Engineer shifts focus to ensuring effective, ongoing operations. You play an integral role in monitoring network performance with Google Cloud Observability, and maintain and troubleshoot any connectivity issues that arise. You also use Network Intelligence Center to monitor and troubleshoot common networking issues. Cymbal Bank will use Cloud Logging to capture and monitor logs from their networking resources. Many of these network resource logs are captured automatically and do not require any setup or configuration. However, you need to enable some resource logs, including those for Application Load Balancers, Firewall Rules Logging, and VPC Flow Logs. Cymbal Bank will use the Cloud Logging page in the Google Cloud console for viewing, filtering, and searching these logs. You'll export the logs into BigQuery for SQL filtering and analysis. Cymbal Bank will also use Cloud Monitoring to visualize network metrics in real time for monitoring network activity. You configure alerts to trigger when metric thresholds approach service level objectives, or indicate connectivity or performance issues, so that support staff can be notified or appropriate incident response automation can be initiated. Cymbal Bank will use VPC Flow Logs and Network Intelligence Center features such as Connectivity Tests, Network Topology, Firewall Insights, and Performance Dashboard to monitor traffic flow and troubleshoot connectivity issues. VPC Flow Logs provide details of traffic being sent or received by IP addresses in subnets. Network Topology lets you visualize network topology as well as metrics about traffic flow. Connectivity Tests lets you verify connectivity between endpoints and provides details of impeding configurations. Performance Dashboard shows packet loss and latency metrics between zones. Firewall Insights lets you monitor activity of firewall rules and identify misconfiguration that would block authorized traffic or allow unauthorized traffic. You will also use Cloud Router, Cloud VPN, and Cloud Interconnect logs and metrics provided by Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring to detect and troubleshoot connectivity problems with hybrid connections from on-premise networks to Google Cloud. Similarly, Cymbal Bank will use these same Network Intelligence Center features to troubleshoot latency and traffic flow issues. These features also let you visualize network topology and routing. Use the Google originated open-source tool PerfKit Benchmarker to test, verify, and monitor network performance.

>> Welcome to Module 6: Your Next Steps. In this module, you'll focus on creating your individualized study plan. In this module, you'll use the notes you've been taking throughout this course to put together a study plan for each week in your Professional Cloud Network Engineer journey. Now that you've explored all five sections of the exam guide, consider what you've learned about your knowledge and skills through the diagnostic questions in this course. You should have a better understanding of what areas you need to focus on and what resources are available. Think about the answers to these questions: When will you take the exam? How many weeks does that give you to prepare? How many hours can you realistically spend preparing for the exam each week? How many total hours will you prepare? Be sure to leave enough time at the end of your plan to retake the diagnostic questions and the sample questions and fill in any gaps in your knowledge that may remain. Take a few minutes to think about how much time you will allocate to preparing for the exam and note your answers in the workbook. The number of weeks in your preparation journey will depend on a variety of factors, such as your prior experience with Google Cloud and how much time you have available to studying each week. You might choose to focus on specific courses or skill badges each week, such as in the sample study plan or instead focus your study on a specific topic, such as VPN configuration. Once you have a high level idea of how many weeks you have to study and how you want to determine your weekly focus, you'll want to build out a plan with weekly goals and study activities. Use the template in your workbook to plan your study goals for each week. Consider: What exam guide sections or topic areas will you focus on? What courses or specific modules will help you learn more? What skill badges or labs will you work on for hands on practice? What documentation links will you review? What additional resources will you use, such as sample questions? You may do some or all of these study activities each week. Let's review an example. If you've identified configuring VPCs as a particular area you need to study, you might choose to structure your study for a week to include targeted modules from the on-demand training, a related skill badge for hands on practice and documentation. Ultimately, you might choose one week to complete an entire course and another week to focus on a skill badge. You can determine the approach that fits your existing skillset. Find the weekly study template at the end of your workbook. Duplicate the weekly template for the number of weeks in your individual preparation journey. Remember, you may need to adjust your plans based on the areas where you need to learn more. For more information about the resources we've discussed in this course, refer to your notes in the student copy of the slides.
