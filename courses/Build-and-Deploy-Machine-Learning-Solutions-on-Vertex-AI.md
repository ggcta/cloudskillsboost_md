# [Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/684)

**Description:**

Earn the intermediate skill badge by completing the Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions with Vertex AI course, where you will learn how to use Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform, AutoML, and custom training services to train, evaluate, tune, explain, and deploy machine learning models.

This skill badge course is for professional Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this Skill Badge, and the final assessment challenge lab, to receive a digital badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

- Write and train models locally in a hosted Vertex Notebook
- Containerize your training code and push it to Google Cloud Artifact Registry
- Create managed image dataset artifacts for experiment tracking
- Train a BigQuery ML (BQML) XGBoost classifier
- Trigger a training job using the Vertex AI Console
- Create a custom model evaluation component using the KFP SDK
- Incorporate pre-built KFP components into your pipeline
- Deploy your trained models to a Vertex Endpoint for online predictions
- Query your model for online predictions and explanations

## Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI

### Lab - [Identify Damaged Car Parts with Vertex AutoML Vision](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/684/labs/526872)

In this lab, you will learn how to train a custom Vertex AI image classification model to recognize damaged car parts.

### Lab - [Deploy a BigQuery ML Customer Churn Classifier to Vertex AI for Online Predictions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/684/labs/526873)

In this lab, you will train, tune, evaluate, explain, and generate batch and online predictions with a BigQuery ML XGBoost model. You will use a Google Analytics 4 dataset from a real mobile application, Flood it!, to determine the likelihood of users returning to the application. You will generate batch predictions with your BigQuery ML model as well as export and deploy it to Vertex AI for online predictions.
