# [Accelerate knowledge exchange with Agentspace](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1191)

**Description:**

Unite Google's expertise in search and AI with Agentspace, an enterprise tool designed to help employees find specific information from document storage, email, chats, ticketing systems, and other data sources, all from a single search bar. The Agentspace assistant can also help brainstorm, research, outline documents, and take actions like inviting coworkers to a calendar event to accelerate knowledge work and collaboration of all kinds.

**Objectives:**

- Use Agentspace to find documents, get answers to questions, brainstorm, and more.
- Create an Agentspace app.
- Mirror your existing access controls for content through authorization to Workspace or a third-party identity provider.
- Enhance functionality by connecting your agent to data stores and actions from Google and other third-party providers.
