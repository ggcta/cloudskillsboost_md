# [Enhance Gemini Model Capabilities](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1241)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Enhance Gemini Model Capabilities skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: leveraging advanced features of Gemini models, including code generation and execution, grounding, controlled content generation, and synthetic data creation, to build more powerful and sophisticated AI applications.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

- Utilize the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for efficient text processing and application development.
- Generate and execute Python code using Gemini 2.0's code generation capabilities to automate tasks and extend model functionality.
- Ground Gemini model responses in factual data using Vertex AI, improving accuracy and reliability.
- Control the style, format, and content of Gemini's generated text using techniques for controlled generation.
- Generate synthetic data using Gemini APIs for various purposes, such as training other machine learning models or augmenting existing datasets.
