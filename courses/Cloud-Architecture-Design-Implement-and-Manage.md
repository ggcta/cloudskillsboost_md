# [Cloud Architecture: Design, Implement, and Manage](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/640)

**Description:**

Earn a skill badge by completing the Cloud Architecture: Design, Implement, and Manage to demonstrate skills in the following: deploy a publicly accessible website using Apache web servers, configure a Compute Engine VM using startup scripts, configure secure RDP using a Windows Bastion host and firewall rules, build and deploy a Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster and then update it, and create a CloudSQL instance and import a MySQL database.

This skill badge is a great resource for understanding topics that will appear in the Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect certification exam.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete the skill badge, and final assessment challenge lab, to receive a digital badge that you can share with your network.

## Cloud Architecure: Design, Implement, and Manage

### Lab - [Deploy a Compute Instance with a Remote Startup Script: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/640/labs/489765)

Configure a Linux Google Compute Engine instance that installs an Apache web server software using a remote startup script, then confirm that Apache has successfully installed.

### Lab - [Configure Secure RDP using a Windows Bastion Host: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/640/labs/489766)

This is a Challenge Lab where you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. You will be asked to deploy the secure Windows machine that is not configured for external communication inside a new VPC subnet, then deploy the Microsoft Internet Information Server on that secure machine.

### Lab - [Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/640/labs/489767)

In this hands-on lab you will build a Docker container image using a tag that allows it to be stored on the Google Container Registry (GCR), then push it out to GCR before deploying. Create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy the sample app to the cluster.
