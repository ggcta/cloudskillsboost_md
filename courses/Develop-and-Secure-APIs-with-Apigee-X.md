# [Develop and Secure APIs with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714)

**Description:**

Earn a skill badge by completing the Develop and Secure APIs with Apigee X quest, where you learn how to modernize your APIs, use service accounts and Google Authentication to securely access backend services from Apigee API proxies, productize APIs using API products and developer portals, secure APIs using features like API keys, OAuth, private variables and fault handling, integrate Apigee with Google Cloud services like Pub/Sub and Cloud Logging, and call Google Cloud APIs like the Natural Language API and the Geocoding API.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge quest, and the final assessment challenge lab, to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

## Develop and Secure APIs with Apigee X

### Lab - [Introduction to APIs in Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408144)

In this lab, you review the architecture and basic functioning of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and then practice by configuring and running Cloud Storage API methods in Cloud Shell.

### Lab - [Modernizing Applications with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408145)

In this lab, you deploy a backend service on Cloud Run. The backend service implements a REST API for a bank, storing customers, accounts, ATMs, and transactions in a Firestore database. You create a shared flow that retrieves and caches content from an external service. You then call that shared flow from your API proxy, and use JavaScript code to modify an API response.

### Lab - [Publishing APIs with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408146)

In this lab, you use API products to package your APIs, and create a developer portal so application developers can try your APIs and sign up to use them.

### Lab - [Securing APIs with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408147)

In this lab, you modify an API to require OAuth tokens for access. You use the SpikeArrest policy to limit the rate of API calls by application, and you use private variables and data masking to hide sensitive data from users who debug API traffic.

### Lab - [Using Google Cloud Services with Apigee X](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408148)

In this lab, you use multiple Google Cloud services from an Apigee API proxy.

### Lab - [Develop and Secure APIs with Apigee X: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/714/labs/408149)

This challenge lab tests your skills and knowledge from the labs in the <b>Develop and Secure Apigee X</b> course.  You should be familiar with the content of the labs before attempting this lab.
