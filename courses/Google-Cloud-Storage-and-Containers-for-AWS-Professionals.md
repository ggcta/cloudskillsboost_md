# [Google Cloud Storage and Containers for AWS Professionals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/519)

**Description:**

This is the third course of a four-course series for cloud architects and engineers with existing AWS knowledge, and it compares Google Cloud and AWS solutions and guides professionals on their use.

This course focuses on Storage Options and containers in Google Cloud. The learners apply the knowledge of storage and containers in AWS to explore the similarities and differences with storage and containers in Google Cloud. Learners get hands-on practice building and managing Google Cloud resources.

**Objectives:**

- Create and configure Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage
- Compare Cloud SQL to Amazon RDS
- Compare Google Cloudâ€™s data lake options with AWS
- Explain how Google Kubernetes Engine differs from Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
- Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Storage in Google Cloud

In this module, you will learn about core storage options in Google Cloud and the use cases for each. You will examine the similarities and differences between Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Cloud Storage, Amazon RDS and Cloud SQL, and the data lake services in both platforms.

> - [ ] Cloud Storage does allow bucket creation using CLI

#### Quiz 4.

> [!important]
> **In your AWS environment, you have set up an AWS RDS database. To authorize connections, you have set up VPC security groups. You have been asked to set up a Cloud SQL database of an equivalent size. You want to use a Google-recommended method to authorize connections in a Cloud SQL database. What should you do?**
>
> - [ ] Encrypt the data.
> - [ ] Use VPC firewalls.
> - [ ] Create a replica in Cloud SQL.
> - [ ] Authorize networks by adding IP addresses to an denylist.

## Containers in Google Cloud

In this module, you will learn how Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Anthos let you orchestrate containers in Google Cloud and in hybrid or multi-cloud environments. You will examine key concepts related to containers and Kubernetes, and explore concepts specific to GKE and the similarities and differences with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Additionally, you will examine how to create and update Deployments to support your workloads in GKE. You will also learn about the purpose of Anthos and how it provides consistent container orchestration across GKE and on-premises environments.
