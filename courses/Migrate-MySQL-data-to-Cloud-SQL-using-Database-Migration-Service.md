## Migrating MySQL data to Cloud SQL using Database Migration Service

### Lab - [Cloud SQL for MySQL: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/629/labs/511543)

In this lab, you create a Google Cloud SQL MySQL instance and perform SQL operations using Google Cloud Platform Console and mysql client. Watch this short video, <a HREF="https://youtu.be/EQJK0tNW-g4">Manage PostgreSQL and MySQL Databases Easily with Cloud SQL</a>.

### Lab - [Migrating to Cloud SQL from Amazon RDS for MySQL Using Database Migration Service](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/629/labs/511544)

In this lab, you migrate MySQL data from an Amazon RDS instance for MySQL to Cloud SQL for MySQL using a one-time Database Migration Service job and an IP allowlist for connectivity. After you create and run the migration job, you confirm that the data have been successfully migrated to your Cloud SQL for MySQL instance.

### Lab - [Migrating On-premises MySQL Using a Continuous Database Migration Service Job](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/629/labs/511545)

In this lab, you migrate an on-premises MySQL database (running on a virtual machine) to Cloud SQL for MySQL using a continuous Database Migration Service job and VPC peering for connectivity. After you create and run the migration job, you confirm that an initial copy of your database has been successfully migrated to your Cloud SQL for MySQL instance. Then, you explore how continuous migration jobs continue to apply data updates from your source database to your Cloud SQL instance until you choose to complete the job. To conclude the migration job, you promote the Cloud SQL instance to be a new standalone database for reading and writing data.

### Lab - [Migrating MySQL User Data When Running Database Migration Service Jobs](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/629/labs/511546)

In this lab, you learn how to migrate MySQL user data when running Database Migration Service jobs. First, you identify the existing MySQL users and update DEFINER to INVOKER for database objects on the source instance. Next, you create and save a Database Migration Service job. Then, before running the migration job, you create the necessary users on the destination database instance. Finally, you start the saved migration job; after the job runs successfully, you check the migrated data in the Cloud SQL for MySQL instance.
