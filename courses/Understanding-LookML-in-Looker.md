# [Understanding LookML in Looker](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/774)

**Description:**

In this quest, you will get hands-on experience with LookML in Looker. You will learn how to write LookML code to create new dimensions and measures, create derived tables and join them to Explores, filter Explores, and define caching policies in LookML.

**Objectives:**

- Define, read, and write LookML
- Create and use different types of dimensions and measures in LookML
- Create derived tables and join them to Explores
- Use and understand the different types Explore filters
- Use caching policies and datagroups

## Understanding LookML in Looker

### Lab - [Looker Developer: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/774/labs/408451)

In this lab, you learn about the fundamental LookML structures, create a view, and join the new view to an existing Explore.

### Lab - [Creating Derived Tables Using LookML](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/774/labs/408453)

In this lab, you create SQL derived and native derived tables in LookML to define new tables that do not already exist in the underlying database.

### Lab - [Caching and Datagroups with LookML](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/774/labs/408455)

In this lab, you learn how caching works in Looker and explore how to use LookML objects called datagroups to define caching policies.
