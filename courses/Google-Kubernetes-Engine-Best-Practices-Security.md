# [Google Kubernetes Engine Best Practices: Security](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/732)

**Description:**

Get Anthos Ready. This Google Kubernetes Engine-centric quest of best practice hands-on labs focuses on

security at scale when deploying and managing production GKE environments -- specifically role-based access control, hardening, VPC networking, and binary authorization.

## Google Kubernetes Engine Best Practices: Security

### Lab - [How to Use a Network Policy on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/732/labs/408227)

In this lab you learn how to improve the security of your Kubernetes Engine by applying fine-grained restrictions to limit intra-cluster network communication.

### Lab - [Using Role-based Access Control in Kubernetes Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/732/labs/408228)

After provisioning two service accounts to represent user personas and three namespaces for dev, test, and prod, you will test the access controls of the personals in each namespace.

### Lab - [Google Kubernetes Engine Security: Binary Authorization](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/732/labs/408229)

This lab deploys a Kubernetes Engine Cluster with the Binary Authorization feature enabled; you'll learn how to whitelist approved container registries and the process of creating and running a signed container.

### Lab - [Hardening Default GKE Cluster Configurations](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/732/labs/408230)

This lab demonstrates some of the security concerns of a default GKE cluster configuration and the corresponding hardening measures to prevent multiple paths of pod escape and cluster privilege escalation
