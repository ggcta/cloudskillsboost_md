# [Analyze and Reason on Multimodal Data with Gemini](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1240)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Analyze and Reason on Multimodal Data with Gemini skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: using Gemini 2.0 Flash to analyze text, image, audio (represented as sheet music), and video data, and to reason about this combined information to draw conclusions and extract insights.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

- Initialize and interact with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model using the Vertex AI SDK in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Analyze text documents using Gemini 2.0 Flash to extract key information, summarize content, and answer questions.
- Analyze images and videos using Gemini 2.0 Flash, extracting descriptions, identifying objects, and answering questions about visual content.
- Analyze audio by using Gemini 2.0 Flash on sheet music representations, understanding musical elements, and making connections between the score and the corresponding audio (not directly, but through the visual representation).
- Construct and utilize Gemini 2.0 Flash prompts that combine multiple data modalities (text, image, sheet music, video) to perform complex reasoning tasks.
- Apply Gemini 2.0 Flash's "thinking mode" to generate more elaborate and reasoned responses to multimodal prompts.
