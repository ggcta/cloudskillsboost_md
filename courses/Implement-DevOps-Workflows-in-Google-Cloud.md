# [Implement DevOps Workflows in Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/716)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Implement DevOps Workflows in Google Cloud skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: creating git repositories with Cloud Source Repositories, launching, managing, and scaling deployments on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and architecting CI/CD pipelines that automate container image builds and deployments to GKE.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

## Implement DevOps Workflows in Google Cloud

### Lab - [Artifact Registry: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/716/labs/515631)

In this lab, you will learn how to use Artifact Registry in Google Cloud.
