# [Create Generative AI Apps on Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1120)

**Description:**

Generative AI applications can create new user experiences that were nearly impossible before the invention of large language models (LLMs). As an application developer, how can you use generative AI to build engaging, powerful apps on Google Cloud?

In this course, you'll learn about generative AI applications and how you can use prompt design and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to build powerful applications using LLMs. You'll learn about a production-ready architecture that can be used for generative AI applications and you'll build an LLM and RAG-based chat application.

**Objectives:**

* Describe generative-AI-based application types and use cases.
* Describe how to build prompt templates to improve model response quality in applications.
* Describe the subsystems of RAG-capable architectures for generative AI applications on Google Cloud.
* Build an LLM and RAG-based chat application.

## Generative AI Applications

In this module, you learn about generative AI applications, and types of applications that can use the power of generative AI. You also learn about foundation models provided by Google, and challenges that exist when using generative AI in your applications.
