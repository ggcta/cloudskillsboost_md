# [Using DevSecOps in your Google Cloud Environment](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/940)

**Description:**

In this course, you will learn the basic skills to implement secure and efficient DevSecOps practices on Google Cloud. You'll learn how to secure your development pipeline with Google Cloud services like Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, and Binary Authorization. This enables you to build, test, and deploy containerized applications with security controls throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

## Using DevSecOps in your Google Cloud Environment

### Lab - [Working with Artifact Registry](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/940/labs/448200)

Artifact Registry is a single place to manage container images and language packages, and is fully integrated with Google Cloud tooling and and runtimes. This makes it simple to integrate it with your CI/CD tooling to set up automated pipelines.

### Lab - [Google Kubernetes Engine Pipeline using Cloud Build](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/940/labs/448201)

Create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image, stores the image in Artifact Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine.

### Lab - [Continuous Delivery with Google Cloud Deploy](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/940/labs/448202)

Create a delivery pipeline using Google Cloud Deploy, create a release for a basic application, and promote the application through a series of Google Kubernetes Engine targets

### Lab - [Google Kubernetes Engine Security: Binary Authorization](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/940/labs/448203)

This lab deploys a Kubernetes Engine Cluster with the Binary Authorization feature enabled; you'll learn how to whitelist approved container registries and the process of creating and running a signed container.
