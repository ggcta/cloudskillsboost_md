# [Security & Identity Fundamentals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770)

**Description:**

Security is an uncompromising feature of Google Cloud services, and Google Cloud has developed specific tools for ensuring safety and identity across your projects. In this fundamental-level quest, you will get hands-on practice with Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, which is the go-to for managing user and virtual machine accounts. You will get experience with network security by provisioning VPCs and VPNs, and learn what tools are available for security threat and data loss protections.

## Security & Identity Fundamentals

### Lab - [Cloud IAM: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508292)

Google Cloud IAM unifies access  control for Cloud Platform services into a single system to present a consistent set of operations. Watch the short video <A HREF="https://youtu.be/PqMGmRhKsnM">Manage Access Control with Google Cloud IAM</A>.

### Lab - [IAM Custom Roles](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508293)

Cloud IAM provides the right tools to manage resource permissions with minimum fuss and high automation. You do not directly grant users permissions. Instead, you grant them roles, which bundle one or more permissions. This allows you to map job functions within your company to groups and roles.

### Lab - [Service Accounts and Roles: Fundamentals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508294)

In this hands-on lab, you learn how to create and manage Service Accounts

### Lab - [VPC Network Peering](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508295)

Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network Peering allows private connectivity across two VPC networks regardless of whether or not they belong to the same project or the same organization.

### Lab - [Getting Started with Cloud KMS](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508297)

In this lab, you work with advanced features of Google Cloud Security and Privacy APIs, including setting up a secure Cloud Storage bucket, managing keys and encrypted data using Key Management Storage, and viewing Cloud Storage audit logs.

### Lab - [Google Cloud Packet Mirroring with OpenSource IDS](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508298)

This lab demonstrates a common enterprise use case for Google Cloud's Packet Mirroring in conjunction with an Open Source Intrusion Detection System.

### Lab - [Setting up a Private Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508299)

Hands-on lab for creating a private cluster in the cloud environment. In a private cluster, nodes do not have public IP addresses, so your workloads run in an environment that is isolated from the Internet. Prerequisites: Experience with Kubernetes Clusters, and CIDR-range IP address.

### Lab - [Securing Google Cloud with CFT Scorecard](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/770/labs/508300)

CFT Scorecard is a utility you can combine with Forseti policies to check for violations in your Google Cloud environment.
