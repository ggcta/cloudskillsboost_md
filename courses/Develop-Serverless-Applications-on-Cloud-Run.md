# [Develop Serverless Applications on Cloud Run](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/741)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Develop Serverless Applications on Cloud Run skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: integrating Cloud Run with Cloud Storage for data management, architecting resilient asynchronous systems using Cloud Run and Pub/Sub, constructing REST API gateways powered by Cloud Run, and building and deploying services on Cloud Run.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

## Develop Serverless Applications on Cloud Run

Twelve years ago, Lily started the Pet Theory chain of veterinary clinics, and has been expanding rapidly. Now, Pet Theory is experiencing some growing pains: their appointment scheduling system is not able to handle the increased load, customers aren't receiving lab results reliably through email and text,and veteranerians are spending more time with insurance companies than with their patients. Lily wants to build a cloud-based system that scales better than the legacy solution and doesn't require lots of ongoing maintenance. The team has decided to go with serverless technology. For the labs in the Develop Serverless Applications on Cloud Run course, you will read through a fictitious business scenario in each lab and assist the characters in implementing a serverless solution.

### Lab - [Build a Serverless App with Cloud Run that Creates PDF Files](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/741/labs/499436)

In this lab you will build a PDF converter web app on Cloud Run, a serverless service, that automatically converts files stored in Cloud Storage into PDFs stored in segregated folders.
