## Manage PostgreSQL Databases on Cloud SQL

### Lab - [Migrate to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL using Database Migration Service](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/652/labs/471756)

In this lab, you migrate a stand-alone PostgreSQL database (running on a virtual machine) to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL using a continuous Database Migration Service job and VPC peering for connectivity.

### Lab - [Connect an App to a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Instance](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/652/labs/471757)

In this lab, you create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a simple application to that cluster. Then, you connect the application to the supplied Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database instance and confirm that it is able to write to and read from it.

### Lab - [Securing a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Instance](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/652/labs/471758)

In this lab, you deploy a new Cloud SQL instance using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). You configure pgAudit to selectively record and track SQL operations performed against that instance, and then you configure and test Cloud SQL IAM database authentication.
