person: Hello and welcome. In this course, you'll explore Gmail, Google's email service part of Google Workspace. Through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities, it's our hope that you'll become more confident using Gmail. With Gmail, your email is stored safely in the cloud. You can access your messages from any computer or device with a web browser. We encourage you to remain signed in to Google Workspace as you complete this course, not just for the activities. You can pause the video lecture or demonstration at any time to explore and practice for yourself, helping to ensure that you understand the topics being discussed. This course follows a fictional customer called On the Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you'll use Gmail to solve a business challenge On the Rise is facing. Let's take a look at the scenario you'll use to learn a few key Gmail features. First, meet Anthony Dillon, the head of product distribution and operations at On the Rise. He has been with the company for three years and has helped coordinate operations as On the Rise has grown into a global chain. Anthony knows that in order to stay competitive, On the Rise needs to listen to its customers but will also need to learn from its external suppliers and vendors. Anthony needs your help. He wants to email a large group of contacts on a regular basis and then automatically sort replies. He also wants to make sure the communication is secure, and that responses are easily searchable. Anthony has launched a new initiative in which he intends to send a monthly survey to external partners. In these emails, he plans to ask suppliers and vendors for their feedback on what is working and where there are opportunities for improvement. He also plans to share a monthly newsletter that is stored on Google Drive. Ready to get started? Let's begin.

- [YouTube: Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfInpcNNHG8)

Before you jump into the course content, let's first explore the agenda. In Module One, we begin with an introduction to Gmail, where you'll learn how to access the service and cover the basics such as composing and sending an email. You'll also explore some of the common actions that can be applied to a Gmail message. In Module Two, you'll learn how to organize your messages using Gmail labels. In Module Three, you'll see how Gmail integrates with other Google Workspace services, such as Google Calendar and Google Drive. In Module Four, you'll learn how to protect your inbox from spam and phishing attacks. Gmail has spam filters that automatically move spam messages, sometimes called junk email, into your spam folder. In Module Five, you'll explore contacts and how you can create and manage your own personal contacts and groups. In Module Six, you'll learn how to manage your Gmail settings. For example, you'll see how to create custom signatures and email templates. Email templates improve productivity by allowing you to define a standard response that you can use to reply to commonly asked questions. And in Module Seven, you'll see ways to be more productive with Gmail. Google is famous for search, and Gmail includes powerful search capabilities and filtering. You'll explore Gmail's Advanced Search and learn how to automatically filter messages. Also, you'll explore ways to customize your Gmail inbox. And as we said earlier, at the end of the course, you'll use Gmail to help solve Anthony's email challenge at On the Rise.

## Introduction to Gmail

In this module, you'll be introduced to Gmail and learn how to access it through your browser. You'll also learn how to send email, manage Gmail conversations, and explore some common actions that can be taken on your messages.

### Video - [Introduction to Gmail](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528550)

person: Welcome to Module One, Introduction to Gmail. In this module, you'll be introduced to Gmail and learn how to access it through your browser. You'll also learn how to send email, manage Gmail conversations, and explore some common actions that can be taken on your messages. Gmail is email by Google. Gmail lets you send, receive, and organize messages using only your web browser. Powerful search helps you find your messages quickly. Gmail also integrates with the other applications in Google Workspace like Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Chat, and Google Meet. with Gmail, your messages are safe and secure with intelligent filtering of spam and malicious messages. Gmail helps you increase your productivity with smart features like smart reply, snooze, and nudges. To ensure you have access to all of the Gmail features, we suggest you access Gmail using Google Chrome. There are a few ways to access Gmail. The simplest way is to navigate to mail.google.com and sign in with your username, which is your email address and password. Alternatively, you can select the Gmail icon from the apps launcher while using another Google Workspace app like Google Drive. You can also download the Gmail app for an Android mobile device from the Google Play Store, or from the Apple App Store for an Apple device. If you haven't done so already, please open Gmail now by typing mail.google.com in a new browser tab. Although Gmail may look similar to email systems you've used before, Gmail uses a few unique approaches to traditional messaging workflows to improve your experience, and more importantly, to save you time. Gmail groups messages with the same subject together in conversations. Conversation view creates a thread of all the messages that you send and receive on a topic, so it's easy to see discussions that may cover days, weeks, or even months. If you prefer a chronological view of messages, you can easily disable conversation view in your Gmail settings. Let's take a look at that now.

### Video - [Conversation view](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528551)

- [YouTube: Conversation view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O17jZDAZgo)

person: Let's see the conversation view in action. Recently I sent out a request for information from my team members. Looking at this email, you can see that I have started to receive their responses. In fact, there are four messages associated with this email. When I open the email, we can see all of the responses to my message grouped together. That is conversation view. Now what if I wanted to turn off conversation view? Let's do this now. I will go into my Gmail settings by choosing the Settings icon above the message list. It looks like a gear. This will reveal the Quick Settings pane. From here, I scroll down to the bottom to the email threading section and disable conversation view and select reload to complete that action. Once Gmail reloads, you can see that the three messages I had received are no longer grouped together, but are now three individual emails. When an email is in conversation view, it's important to note that if you are someone that is part of that conversation changes the subject of the message, Gmail will create a new conversation.

### Video - [Create and send a message](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528552)

- [YouTube: Create and send a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-naU3klJxLY)

person: What about composing a new message? To compose a new message in Gmail, click the Compose button to open the message window. To choose the recipient, click in the To field and start typing an email address. If the recipient happens to be in your organization or is part of your personal contacts, Gmail will suggest names based on the characters you've typed. As you type, the name suggested will change accordingly. The CC and BCC fields are optional. To add them, choose the respective buttons on the right of the message window. Next type a subject for your message. Subjects are optional, but recommended. Let's move on to the body of the message. Gmail has several formatting options to help you relay information exactly as you intend. Choose the Formatting Options button to open the toolbar for formatting text. The Formatting Options toolbar includes Undo and Redo actions as well as the font, style, and size of your text. This includes being able to bold, italicize, underline, and choose the color of your text. You can set the text alignment, bullet or numbered list, indent the text, and more. To remove existing formatting, click the Remove Formatting button. Perhaps you want to share a file. To share a file with your recipients, you can attach files from your computer or share files from Google Drive. To upload a file to Gmail from your computer, click the Attach Files button. Browse for the file and select it to add it to the message. To share a file from Google Drive, click the Insert Files Using Drive button and select the file you want to share. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files are shared as Google Drive links. Sharing a link to a file stored in Google Drive has the advantage of allowing you to share large files via email. Also, because it's a link, recipients will always see the latest version of the file. When you add a Google Drive file to a message, Gmail checks to see whether your recipients have access to the file. If your recipients do not have access, after you click Send, you'll be prompted to change the sharing setting of the file. You'll have the option to change the sharing settings to allow recipients to view, comment, or edit the file. You can also insert links, emoji and photos. Sometimes almost immediately after clicking send you realize that you have forgotten an important note in your message or notice that you didn't include a key recipient. Undo Send adds a short delay to the message leaving your inbox so you can edit it if necessary before sending it again. Undo Send is enabled by default. You can change the delay time before the email is sent in your Gmail settings. To use Undo Send, look for a small banner in the lower left corner of Gmail. To cancel sending your message, simply click Undo.

- [YouTube: Activity 1 explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t27W2AIVJc)

Now it's your turn to give it a try. In the following activity, you'll compose an email, explore some formatting options, add an attachment from Drive, and then send your message. After that, you'll select Undo Send, make a small edit, and resend the message.

### Video - [Email replies](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528555)

- [YouTube: Email replies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7RrCH4V0g)

Person: Once you've received and read an incoming message, you can send replies. To reply to a message, right click on the message and select Reply or Reply to All from the Message Actions menu. You can also open the message and select the Reply or Reply to All button from below the message view. There are also Reply and Reply to All buttons in the top right corner of the message window. You will only see the reply to all option if the message has multiple recipients. If you frequently reply to all the recipients of messages you receive, you can set reply to all as the default option for replies in your Gmail settings. When you select Reply, the recipient will be the composer of the message you're viewing. If you select Reply to All, the message will be sent to the composer and all the original recipients of the message. You can also edit the recipients before you send a reply. Select the To field and type a name or email address to add a recipient or choose an existing recipient and select the X to remove them. Forwarding a message is done in the same way as a reply. Choose Forward from the Message Action menu or select the Forward button. When forwarding, you have to specify the recipient. You can also edit the subject of the message. Changing the subject will start a new conversation which can be useful, for example, if an existing thread has diverged from the original topic, or if you want to start a new thread with others but retain the history of the initial conversation. When you're using the Gmail web interface or the Gmail mobile app, your messages are automatically saved in the cloud. You can close a message you're composing and return to at any time by selecting the Drafts label. There's also an option to forward a message as an attachment. Email conversation will be converted to an EML file, which is a standard message format that can be viewed in most email applications.

### Video - [Gmail actions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528556)

- [YouTube: Gmail actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0c5VMFX8U)

person: Gmail is a web based app, but it's been designed to work a lot like a desktop email app. The Gmail interface changes in response to your selections. For example, if you select one or more messages you received by choosing the box next to the sender, you'll see additional buttons appear at the top of the message list. These actions include options to delete messages, mark them as spam, or move them to a label. Let's explore each of the actions. The first button is the Select action. Choosing it will select all the messages in the current view of your email. Selecting the drop down arrow will open a menu of additional selection options-- all, none, read, unread, starred and unstarred. Once you've chosen the selection, you can choose a message action to apply to the selected messages. Next is the archive action. Archiving a message removes it from your inbox but not from Gmail. Archived messages can be found via search by choosing a label that it was applied to or by selecting the all mail label from the label list. While viewing archive messages, the moved inbox action appears to restore a message from the archive. Using archiving helps to keep your inbox uncluttered, which allows you to stay focused and productive. The Report Spam action labels a message as spam, removing it from your inbox and reporting it to Google. Reporting messages as spam helps increase the effectiveness of Gmail automatic intelligent email filtering that prevents spam and other suspicious messages from reaching your inbox. We'll discuss keeping Gmail safe later on in this course. The Delete action moves the message into the trash, which is also a label. Messages in the trash can be restored, but if a message is not restored within 30 days, it is automatically and permanently deleted from Gmail. Your mail administrator may be able to restore permanently deleted message. The Mark As Unread action restores the message's unread status after you viewed its contents. The Snooze action removes a message from the inbox so that automatically reappears at a time of your choosing in the future. Select snooze and choose from one of the suggested future times or select Pick Date and Time to set a specific day and time for the message to reappear at the top of your inbox. Snooze messages can be found at any time before their automatic reappearance by selecting the Snooze label from the label list. You can un-snooze or change the reappearance date and time whenever you choose. The Add to Task action creates a new task in the My Tasks list with a link to the message. The subject of the message becomes the task title. We'll be reviewing how to leverage tasks to improve productivity later on. The Move To action moves a message out of the inbox while applying a label to it. Moving a message combines archiving and organizing into a single action. The label's action opens a menu of the labels in Gmail where you can select one or more to apply to the message. You can also create a new label from the menu. Labels are used to organize messages in Gmail similar to folders in other email systems, but with a few advantages. You'll have an opportunity to work with labels in a few moments. The More button opens a menu of additional actions including Mark as Unread, Mark as Not Important, Add Star, Filter Messages Like These, Mute, and Forward as Attachment.

### Video - [Message actions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528557)

- [YouTube: Message actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcIpi3KUvk)

person: Gmail automatically marks some messages as important using the following signals-- who you email and how often you email them, which emails you open, which emails you reply to, keywords that are in emails you usually read, which emails you star, archive, or delete. You can also use the Mark as Important action to manually designate a message as important. This will help Gmail refine the process so that it becomes more useful and specific to your workflow. If a message was automatically marked as important, you can also mark it as unimportant if the classification was inaccurate. Any message marked as important will have a marker next to the sender in the message list. If you hover over the marker, you'll see if the message was marked important because of Google assumptions or your own action. The importance attribute also affects how messages appear in the different inbox types that are available in Gmail. We'll explore the various inbox types later in the course. Another way to classify a message as important is to use the Add Star action. When you add a star, a gold star appears before the sender in the message list. Any message that you add a star to will also appear when you select the Starred label in the label list. In your Gmail settings, you can add additional stars and icons to further refine a system of classifying messages for your workflow. There are times when your participation in an email thread or conversation no longer requires any attention or action. Gmail allows you to mute a conversation to ensure that future replies don't interrupt you or appear in your inbox. The message will be archived and marked with a muted label. You can still search for and view muted conversations, and you can choose to unmute a conversation to return the message to your inbox when a future reply is received. Unlike other labels, the muted label does not appear in the Gmail label list. Sometimes the sheer number of emails you receive can be overwhelming, especially with requests from colleagues and partners to provide input and take action. Nudges in email will prompt you to follow up by suggesting messages that need your attention because you haven't yet replied to them. The emails are returned to the top of your inbox with a prompt to either reply or follow up. Every day the world seems to get a little smaller. You may receive an email from a colleague or partner in a language other than the one you understand. Gmail can help with one click translation of messages. Open the message, select More, and then Translate Message from the menu. Gmail will automatically detect the source language and translate it to the language you use for Gmail. You can change either language from the translation toolbar in the message. You can also choose View Original Message to go back to the message as it was received. Another machine learning powered feature in Gmail helps you write your emails faster. Smart Compose offers suggestions to complete words as you type. Gmail will learn from your writing style so that over time, the suggestions are tailored to the way you communicate. Smart Compose is simple to use. As you type, the suggestions will appear automatically. Click Tab to accept the suggestion and complete the word or just keep typing to ignore it.

## Organize your email

Labels in Gmail allow you to organize messages based on different contexts. In this module you will learn how to create and manage labels, and how to apply them to your messages.

### Video - [Organize your email](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528559)

- [YouTube: Organize your email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgNp0x7Y-ys)

person: Welcome to Module 2: Organize your email. In this module we'll cover how to use labels in Gmail to organize messages. Labels allow you to organize messages based on different contexts. Selecting or searching for any of the labels applied to a message will help you find it quickly. Gmail has a number of system labels that are always in the label list. We've already mentioned some of them. System labels include Inbox, Starred, Snoozed, Sent, Drafts, Important, Scheduled, All Mail, Spam, and Trash. To create a label choose "more" in the label list and scroll down to reveal "create new label." Select "create new label" and enter your new label name in the text box to create the label. You can also make your new label a sub label of any of the labels you previously created. Choose the "next label under" check box, select the parent label from the dropdown list, and select create to save. Applying a label to a message can be done a few different ways. You can select a message from your inbox. Click the "move to" icon, then select a label from the list. These steps will both archive the message and apply the label to it. Or you can drag a message from your inbox to a label to achieve the same result. To apply one or more labels to a message but not archive it, use the labels icon. To view all messages with a particular label assigned, select the label in the list along the left side of the Gmail window. You can remove a label from an email message in several ways as well. Select the label from the list, select the messages you wish to remove from the label, and choose the remove label icon. Or you can select the message or messages, select the label's icon and deselect the labels that no longer apply. Alternatively, you can open the message and X out of the labels that no longer apply. Like many message level actions label assignments can also be managed by selecting the messages and right-clicking to reveal the context-sensitive actions menu.

- [YouTube: Activity 2 explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOUGtWJLPTg)

Now it's your turn. In this next activity, you'll create a few labels that are relevant to your workflow or to enable the organization you need. After you've created your labels, practice applying labels to a message and removing label assignments. Explore the methods discussed earlier to see which approach works best for you.

### Document - [Activity 2 Create and use labels](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/documents/528561)

### Video - [Apply and manage labels](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528562)

- [YouTube: Apply and manage labels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4u2EZxyXH8)

person: After you create some personal labels, you can change how they behave. If you hover over the label name in the label list, you'll see a "more" button that you can select to expose label customizations. You can change a label background and color and text by choosing either one of the predefined themes or custom colors. Adding a color to a label can help you visually identify it. These is especially useful if the label has a long name that may be truncated in the message list. You can also choose whether you want the label to always appear in the label list, always be hidden, or only appear if it contains unread messages. Hidden labels can always be located by selecting "more" in the label list to reveal them. When you applied your label, you probably noticed that it appears in the message list before the subject of the message. If you don't need this behavior, you can disable the label's appearance on messages in the message list. You can also edit the name of the label, make it a sub label, add a sub label to it, or remove the label entirely. Please note that removing a label does not remove the messages associated with it. They remain in Gmail and can always be found later. Gmail has a lot of smart features that learn from your interaction with messages. These features classify messages using machine learning. The default inbox has categories that automatically sort messages so that you can focus on one type of message at a time. There are five categories. Primary. Primary messages are from people you know and any messages that aren't automatically or manually added to another category. Social. Social messages are from social networks. Promotions. Promotions are deals, ads, offers, and other messages soliciting a product or service. Updates. Updates are notifications, receipts, statements, and invoices from purchases made where your Gmail account was used as the contact information. And forums. Forums are messages from Google groups, other online groups, discussion boards, and mailing lists. Categories can be displayed at the top of your inbox, which provides quick access to your categorized email. You can choose which category to display in your Gmail settings. When categories are enabled, you can choose to receive notifications only when messages arrive in your inbox or primary tab cutting down on distractions. You can view all of the messages in a category by selecting its tab above the message list or from the label list under categories. Any emails that you archive will not appear in a category tab.

## Gmail integration

In this module you will learn how Gmail integrates with other Google Workspace apps to help make you more productive and effective.

### Video - [Gmail integration](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528564)

- [YouTube: Gmail integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3AH8A_Vtj4)

person: Welcome to Module 3: Gmail integration. Now that you've learned some of the basics, let's discuss integration. Email is a large part of our working lives. In this module you'll learn how Gmail integrates with other Google Workspace apps to increase productivity. Part of the strength of Gmail is its seamless integration with the rest of Google Workspace. The ability to share files with collaborators both within and outside your organization via Google Drive is a great example of how Gmail leverages the power of Google Workspace to approve a common workflow. Sharing a link to a file or folder in Google Drive makes it possible to share very large files that might otherwise exceed the limits of Gmail and are receiving mail systems if the files were actually attached to the message. When composing a new message or replying to or forwarding an existing message, you can choose the "insert files using drive" icon to open the Google Drive search window. To narrow your search, choose one of the views in Drive. You can select "my drive" for content you own, "shared drives" for content you have access to as part of a group, "shared with me" for content that another person has given you access to, or "recent" for files you've viewed or modified recently. You can also choose to upload files from your device to Google Drive for sharing. You can share any type of file stored in Google Drive. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slide documents are shared as a drive link. Other file types can be shared as a link or as an attachment to the message. Gmail will automatically detect whether the file is accessible by the recipients impromptu to set the sharing settings when you click send. You can give the recipients the ability to view, comment, or edit the field. If you don't have the necessary sharing privileges to the file, you'll have to request permission from the file owner. Your organization can also limit your ability to share files with contacts outside your organization. PDFs, Images, and Microsoft Office documents can be added to the file as an attachment. It's important to understand that an attachment is actually a copy of the original file. As a copy, any changes made by the recipient will not appear in your original document in Google Drive and vice versa. Now that we've explored how Gmail integrates with Google Drive, let's take a look at the integration between Gmail and Google Calendar.

### Video - [Create a calendar event from Gmail](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528565)

- [YouTube: Create a calendar event from Gmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jV90gqaaE)

person: Gmail also has integration with Google Calendar. When you receive invitations for an event, Gmail automatically adds those events to your calendar even if the event wasn't created in Google Calendar. Any message can be used to create an event on your calendar. Let's see how this works. Open a message and select the More action button. Select Create event from the menu. A new event details window will open in a new browser tab. The subject of the email automatically becomes the title of the event, but you can edit it. The body of the message will become the details of the event. Choose a date and time. Add guests. And select Save to add the event to the calendar. Gmail has a side panel on the right side of the window that enables quick access to your calendar. Choose the Google Calendar icon to open the calendar panel. Select the day and date to open the mini calendar to change the month and day you want to view. You can also choose options to switch between a day and schedule view and select which calendars to view. Select any existing event to view its details. Click anywhere on the calendar view to create a new event using a basic event editor. The event title will default to the subject of the message you're currently viewing. Select Edit to edit the event in the Gmail pane. Select Edit in Calendar to open a new tab with the full event details and options.

- [YouTube: Integration with Calendar, Meet and Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQpfZH3wL4)

person: Messages often require us to complete one or more tasks. Gmail improves your efficiency and responsiveness by enabling completion of some of these tasks within the message itself with Dynamic emails. For example, you can RSVP to events, fill out forms, respond to comments in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. The best part of Dynamic email content is that it works automatically, with new capabilities being added over time. A useful app found in the side panel is tasks. Select the tasks icon to view your tasks and task lists. If you have not used the app before, you'll just have one task list. You can rename this list and add other lists to suit your personal workflow. A task can be as simple as a few words in the title field, or you can add more details. Choose what task list the task will appear in, choose a date and time to complete the task, or even add subtasks if your task has multiple steps. If you choose a date and time, you can also set the task to repeat. After a date has been added to a task, it will also appear on your primary Google Calendar. The task app is also accessible from Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides. Gmail also integrates with Google Meet. Google Meet is the video meeting app for Google workspace. The me panel will appear with buttons that read new meeting and my meetings. If the Google Meet options are not visible, you can enable them from your Gmail settings page. Google Chat is a message platform built for teams and is included in Google workspace. Just like Google Meet, you can control whether you want to display the Google chat pane in Gmail from your Gmail settings page.

## Protect your Inbox

Gmail provides many ways to protect your Inbox. In this module you will explore how Gmail automatically protects you and how you can customize settings to ensure that you are only receiving the content you need.

### Video - [Protect your Inbox](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528570)

- [YouTube: Protect your Inbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NFSmFIW4HI)

person: Welcome to Module 4: Protect your Inbox. Gmail provides several ways to protect your inbox. In this module, we'll explore Gmail's automatic protection and how you can customize settings to ensure that you receive the content you need. Gmail automatically identifies spam messages using artificial intelligence and the crowd-source identification of suspicious emails by over a billion users worldwide. We've already covered the ability to mark a message as spam, but now let's look at some of the actions you can take to manage your spam messages. The spam label allows to view and manage spam messages. Messages that have been in spam for more than 30 days are automatically deleted. You should check spam periodically to find messages that may have been incorrectly marked as spam. If you believe a message was incorrectly classified as spam, you can select Not spam to return the message to your inbox. To prevent a sender's legitimate messages from being marked as spam in the future, you can add the sender to your contacts or create a filter. We'll cover both of these options later in the course. After reviewing messages in your spam folder, you may want to completely delete them from your system. You can do that in two ways. To delete a single message, right-click on the message and select Delete forever. If you want to delete all of your messages in your spam folder, select Delete all spam messages now. Earlier we reviewed the spam action for messages that remove messages from your inbox and label them as spam. You can also select more next to the reply button when viewing a message and choose to Report spam or Report phishing. In addition to the messages being labeled as spam and removed from your inbox, a copy of it will be sent to Google for review. You may have an unfortunate situation that requires you to block emails from a particular sender. To stop receiving messages from a sender, open the message, select more, and then choose Block from the menu. All future messages from this sender will go directly to spam. You can unblock them using the same process. Gmail will also automatically identify mass emails like ads, promotions, and newsletters that you may have signed up for. An unsubscribe button will be added to these messages. If you choose to unsubscribe, it may take several days for the messages to stop. Or, as we described previously, you can also mark the messages as spam or just block the sender. If you need to send private or sensitive information via email, Gmail's confidential mode can help ensure that only the intended recipient can view your message. Access to the contents of an email can be time-limited, require a code to view, or be revoked at any time after you send it. When composing an email, choose turn confidential mode on/off to open the options window. There you can set an expiration time frame. You can also choose whether your recipient will have to generate an SMS passcode to view the message. Recipients who don't use Gmail are required to generate a passcode by email or SMS. Your recipients will not be able to download, copy, print, or forward a confidential message. If you ever want to remove access to the message before the expiration date, open it from your sent mail and select Remove access. Recipients will no longer be able to view the message. This feature is optional for organizations using Google Workspace and is subject to policies enabled in the Google Workspace admin council. If you cannot access this feature, contact the persons responsible for managing Google Workspace for your organization.

## Contacts

In this module you'll explore how to effectively use contacts in Gmail. We'll discuss the differences between directory and personal contacts, and you will learn how to create and manage your own personal contacts and groups.

### Video - [Contacts](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528572)

- [YouTube: Contacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlK81c-U9Fg)

person: Welcome to "Module 5: Contacts." In this module, we'll explore how to use contacts in Gmail. We'll explore the differences between directory and personal contacts, and you'll learn how to create and manage your own personal contacts in groups. Using contacts in Gmail helps you keep all your contact information in one place and reach several people at once. To view your contacts, choose the apps launcher and select the contacts icon. Contacts will open in a new tab. In the contacts window, there is a menu on the left. This menu has groups of contacts, including your directory and personal contacts. You can also open your contacts by visiting contacts.google.com in your browser. So, who are your directory contacts? You may have noticed that when you compose a message in Gmail suggestions will appear for recipients in the "To:," "Cc:," and "Bcc:" fields. Initially, these suggestions will be populated with other Google Workspace users in your organization. These contacts are from the directory of contacts that you have access to based on your organization's policies. You can't modify the information in any of the directory contacts but you can add them to your personal contacts or hide them. To create a new personal contact, select "Create contact" and choose "Create a contact." Enter the information in the fields provided. Choose "Show more" to see additional contact fields and if necessary, you can use a custom field. Your personal contacts are listed in alphabetical order by first name. To control which columns appear in the list in their order, click the "List settings" button in the top right of the contacts page. After you've created or added contacts, you can edit or delete them. Choose the contact's name to open the information card. Then, click the "Edit contact" button to change information for the contact. You can also select the star to mark the contact as important and add them to the "Starred contacts" section. Certain information about a contact cannot be edited. This includes information that is automatically populated from the contact's Google profile, as well as their organization. The contact card will also show recent interactions with your contact, including messages and events. This is particularly useful, as the interactions are actually links. You can select any of these links to go straight to the message or event interaction from the contact card. Select "More actions" to see options to print, export, hide from contacts, delete the contact, or select a label. Next, let's see how you create a personal group of contacts.

### Video - [Create a personal group](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/200/video/528573)

- [YouTube: Create a personal group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxUD_uaxVtA)

person: Like messages in Gmail, contacts can also be organized with labels. To group contacts, select Create label from the menu, give it a name, and save. Once you have a label, you can apply it to create a personal group of contacts. Select the contact or group of contacts that you want to label by hovering over the contact name and choosing the selection box. At the top of the contacts list, choose the Manage labels action button, and select one or more of your existing labels to apply to the contact. If none of your existing labels apply, you can choose Create label to add a new label and apply it. Once your label has been populated with contacts, you can use it as a personal email list to quickly add multiple recipients to an email in Gmail. When composing an email in Gmail, type the name of the label into the To, Cc, or Bcc fields, and use the suggestion by selecting either the Enter key or choosing the label name to select it. The context in the label will populate the address field. You can add or delete recipients before sending the message.

- [YouTube: Import, export and merge contacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaGdKQHh5r0)

person: If you're switching to Google workspace from another system, you can import your contacts to populate your personal contacts list. First, you'll have to export your contacts from the system where they reside. Google Contacts supports two types of contact files-- comma separated values and VCard. After you export your contacts, Open Google Contacts and select import from the menu. If you wish, you can assign a label to the imported contacts at this time. Then, browse your computer for the contacts file and select Import. To manually add more than one contact at a time, select Create contact and choose create multiple contacts. Type the names, email addresses, or both names and email addresses separated by commas to create multiple contacts. To export contacts, select one or more contacts and then select export from the menu. Choose the format for the export by selecting from the options under export as Google CSV, Outlook CSV, or VCcard. Select export to download a file of the contacts. You can also choose to export starred contacts, frequently contacted or contacts from one of your labels. Google can identify and merge duplicate contacts. On the menu, Merge and fix will show the number of contacts that have duplicates. Select merge and fix to show the list of duplicates. Select merge all to combine all of the duplicates. To merge a single contact from the list, select merge between the suggestion cards to combine the information into one listing. You can also dismiss the suggestion to merge by selecting dismiss. You may need to merge contacts if you have just imported them from another system, or if your contact list has been migrated from another system as part of the Google workspace rollout.

## Manage Gmail settings

This module explores unique features in Gmail that are designed to save you time and improve your productivity. You will learn how to create your own Gmail signatures, email templates, out of office alerts, and more.

person: Welcome to Module 6: Manage Gmail settings. This module explores unique features in Gmail that are designed to save you time and improve your productivity. In this module, we'll explore Gmail signatures, email templates, out-of-office alerts, automatic forwarding, and email sending options. To create a signature for your Gmail messages, select the Settings button and "see all settings" from the menu. Under the General tab, scroll down to signature. Select "create new" to start a new signature. Name your signature and add the text, images, and styles your equire. Your signature will be appended to the end of outgoing messages. Remember to select "save changes" at the bottom of the settings page. Gmail allows you to create multiple signatures. After you create a signature, you can change the signature defaults. For new emails, use "no signature" or choose one of the signatures you've created. You can also choose "no signature" or one of the existing signatures when you reply to or forward an email. To manually add a signature to a message you're composing, select the insert signature button, then choose from one of your available signatures to add it to the message. If you find that you use the same response to messages often, you can create an email template. For example, you may work at a help desk and frequently get asked the same question, which requires a standard response. Before you can use an email template, you must enable templates. To do this, select the Settings button and select "see all settings." Switch to the advanced tab and ensure that templates are enabled. Remember to save your changes. To create a new template, compose a message and add a subject and message content. Then select "more options." Hover over Templates, then "save draft as template," and then select "save as new template." Name your template and select "save." To use your template when composing a new message, select "more options." Hover over Templates and select the desired template from the list. The template text will be added to the subject and message. However, if you've already typed a subject, the subject will not be altered. To send an automatic reply to emails you receive while you're out of the office, you can create an automatic out-of-office reply. In your Gmail settings, scroll to "Out-of-Office AutoReply," and type a subject and message. When you're ready to enable the automatic reply, select the radio button to turn your Out-of-Office AutoReply on. Choose a first day to begin the automated responses. Optionally, add a last day to end the responses. By default, all messages will receive an automated reply while this feature is enabled. But if someone sends you more than one message, the response will only be sent once every four days. You can also choose to send responses to only people in your contacts and/or only people in your organization. Please note that while we refer to this feature as the Out-of-Office AutoReply setting, some Google Workspace accounts may refer to it as "Vacation Responder."

- [YouTube: Other settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egNsTkru4dg)

person: There are also several ways Gmail can forward your messages automatically to another address. Enabling automatic forwarding will send all of your messages to another address except for spam. In your Gmail settings, choose the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab, and select the button to add a forwarding address. Here you can choose how you want forwarded messages to be treated in your Gmail inbox. You may choose to keep your copy in the inbox, mark the copy as read, archive your copy, or delete your copy. If you need to forward messages to more than one account or selectively forward messages, create a filter instead. This feature is optional for organizations using Google Workspace and is subject to policies enabled in the Google Workspace admin council. If you cannot access this feature, contact the persons responsible for managing Google Workspace for your organization. Your role may require you to use multiple email addresses or you may occasionally have to send mail on behalf of another Gmail user. The "send mail as" feature in Gmail can enable you to choose from multiple "from" addresses when sending messages. In your Gmail settings, choose the Accounts tab and "add another email address" next to "send mail as." Enter the name and address you want to send from and choose whether you want to treat the address as an alias. If you want to receive replies to messages sent using the address, select "treat as an alias." If you are sending on behalf of another user and don't want to receive replies in your mailbox, uncheck this option. Next, choose whether you want the reply to address to be different from the sending address. Before you can send an email with the additional address, Gmail will send a verification message to the mailbox for the additional email address. To enable the additional email address, the recipient must approve the "send mail as" request. Alternatively, you can supply the verification code in the message so you can complete the process yourself.

person: Welcome to Module 7: Become more productive with Gmail. In this module, you'll learn how to personalize your Gmail experience and use features to enhance your productivity and speed up your workflow. We'll explore how to create filters, search for messages, delay the sending of messages until a specified time, use keyboard shortcuts, apply different inbox types, and enable desktop notifications. We've learned about organizing messages with labels and stars. How about automatically applying labels to messages as you receive them? Gmail can do this and more to increase your efficiency and productivity with filters. Let's see how that works now.

- [YouTube: Search Gmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIzc4U7D2g)

person: Google has always been synonymous with the ability to search on the Internet. The apps in Google Workspace have the same powerful search capability to ensure you can always find what you need. We've used the Gmail search box to create a filter. Now let's examine search in Gmail a little more closely. You can type what you're looking for into the search box including people's names, email addresses, message subjects, in full or in part, and words or phrases in the message body. Gmail will suggest search terms as you type based on past searches and information in your Gmail account. Search tips will appear above the message list to help narrow your results. Gmail search also supports a number of search operators like from, to, label, file name, and more. There are other options to search for messages beyond the search box. Right clicking a message in the message list will open a message actions menu with two search options. Find emails from, and whatever the sender may be, and Find emails with this subject. Note, clicking the question mark and help then searching for search will reveal articles on Gmail search operators.

- [YouTube: Other productivity settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpySkU0CmfU)

person: When you compose an email, it might not be appropriate to send it immediately. You can automatically send a message at a predetermined time using Schedule send. Compose a message and add a recipient. Instead of choosing Send, select the dropdown on the Send button and select Schedule send. You can choose from the suggested dates and times or pick a date and time. The message will be labeled as Scheduled and will be sent at the time you choose. Open the Scheduled label to view your scheduled messages. Open a message to cancel sending and to convert the message back to a draft to be edited and rescheduled or edited and sent immediately. To save time and speed up your interaction with Gmail, you can enable keyboard shortcuts from your Gmail settings. The key combination will differ depending on your operating system. To see a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, including which need to be turned on, type the question mark when you have Gmail open. Give it a try now. Personalizing your Gmail experience can enhance your productivity and speed up your workflow. Gmail has custom inboxes with different layouts and features and even supports multiple inboxes. You can switch between inbox types at any time without losing access to your messages or affecting labels. The default inbox includes categories to automatically sort your incoming messages. We discussed these earlier in the course. Choose Important first if you want to see messages marked as important by Gmail in a top section in the messages list with everything else in a section below it. The same layout applies for Unread first and Starred first, with unread and starred messages in the top section and everything else below. Priority Inbox has the most options that can be configured with sections for important, unread, starred, and everything else from top to bottom. Multiple Inboxes add sections based on the search criteria and operators that you define. You can explore the various inbox types and customizations in your Gmail settings to find the one that works best for you. Remember, you are not changing your messages by switching the inbox type. You are just changing how your messages are presented to you. Take some time to do that now. Gmail may be a web app, but Google has designed it to act like a desktop email application with features like notifications and drag and drop for messages. For example, you can use the handle next to a message in your inbox to drag a message to a label in your label list. To enable desktop notifications, open Gmail settings and scroll to Desktop Notifications. Select Click here to enable desktop notifications for mail. Choose which messages you want to receive notifications for and select Save Changes.

person: Congratulations on completing this course. Let's take a few minutes to review what you've learned. We started with the basics of composing, sending, and replying to messages in Gmail. You also learned about the actions that can be applied to a message. You learned how Gmail works differently to many other mail systems and its use of labels. In particular, you learned how to apply multiple labels to a single message, and how to create your own label hierarchy to suit your way of working. You also learned how Gmail integrates with Google Drive, and other Google Workspace services. You learned how to create and manage your own personal contacts and groups, and now have an understanding of how to protect your inbox from spam and phishing emails. You got practice using Gmail search and filters to manage incoming messages and to locate emails of interest quickly. You learned how filters are a particularly powerful feature in Gmail, and we encourage you to explore how you can use them to improve your workflow and efficiency. And you gained insight into features that others may not be aware of, such as being able to send a confidential email, delay the sending of a message, and the creation and use of an email template for repetitive replies. You learned how to customize Gmail by choosing and configuring the inbox type that best suits your way of working. And finally, you helped solve a business challenge being faced by our fictional Google Workspace customer On the Rise. We hope that you enjoyed the course and now feel more confident using Gmail. As a cloud application, Google is adding new features all the time so do continue to explore them as they are released.
