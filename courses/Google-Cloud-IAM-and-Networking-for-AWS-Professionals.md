# [Google Cloud IAM and Networking for AWS Professionals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/522)

**Description:**

This is the first course of a four-course series for cloud architects and engineers with existing AWS knowledge, and it compares Google Cloud and AWS solutions and guides professionals on their use.

This course focuses on Identity and Access Management (IAM) and networking in Google Cloud. The learners apply the knowledge of access management and networking in AWS to explore the similarities and differences with access management and networking in Google Cloud. Learners get hands-on practice building and managing Google Cloud resources.

**Objectives:**

- Explain how Google Cloudâ€™s resource hierarchy differs from AWS
- Explain best practices for Google Cloudâ€™s resource hierarchy, including organizations, folders, and projects.
- Explain the differences between Google Cloud IAM and AWS IAM
- Configure Google Cloud IAM to implement best practices for access control
- Describe the differences in AWS and Google Cloud service accounts

## Resources and Access Management in Google Cloud

In this module, you draw on your knowledge of AWS to discuss how you can set up your resource hierarchy and configure access in Google Cloud. You learn how resources get organized with projects, how Identity and Access Management (IAM) lets you control access to resources, and how to use service accounts in Google Cloud. You'll also explore various ways to interact with Google Cloud.

> - [ ] Google Cloud IAM role
> - [ ] Google Cloud IAM service account
> - [ ] Google Cloud IAM user

#### Quiz 5.

> [!important]
> **The AWS resource hierarchy uses organizational units to organize accounts, which then contain resources. How would you create a similar hierarchy in Google Cloud?**
>
> - [ ] Folders, projects, resources
> - [ ] Projects, folders, resources
> - [ ] Folders, organizational units, resources
> - [ ] Accounts, folders, resources

## Networking in Google Cloud

In this module, you apply your knowledge of networking in AWS to explore the similarities and differences with networking in Google Cloud. You learn about Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), routing and firewalls in Google Cloud, and the variety of options Google Cloud offers for connecting networks.
