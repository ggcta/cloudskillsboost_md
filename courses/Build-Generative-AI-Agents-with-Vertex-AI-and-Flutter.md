# [Build Generative AI Agents with Vertex AI and Flutter](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1162)

**Description:**

In this course, you learn how to develop an app using Flutter, Google's portable UI toolkit, and integrate the app with Gemini, Google's family of generative AI models. You also use Vertex AI Agent Builder, Google's platform for building and managing AI Agents and applications.

**Objectives:**

* Describe generative AI and the use of models and tools to build Gen AI applications.
* Implement Gen AI features in a Flutter app by integrating with Gemini and a Reasoning Engine agent.

## Introduction

The course consists of two modules:

Flutter, Gemini, and Vertex AI - This is the first module of the course that contains four lessons that provide an introduction to the module, and an overview of Generative AI and Gemini, Vertex AI, and Flutter. Generative AI on Vertex AI - This module contains five lessons that include an introduction to the module, and lessons where you learn about Generative AI on Vertex AI, Vertex AI Agent Builder, Vertex AI Search, and using a Reasoning Engine Agent in Gen AI applications.

## Flutter, Gemini, and Vertex AI

You'll learn about Flutter for app development, Gemini and its use in generative AI, and Vertex AI, which are the underlying frameworks and platforms that are used to build Gen AI apps.

## Generative AI on Vertex AI

In this module, we'll discuss some of the tools that are part of the Vertex AI platform, and review how you can use a Reasoning Engine agent to build generative AI applications. You'll also complete a lab to integrate an AI Agent with a Flutter App using Vertex AI.

Generative AI on Vertex AI lets you build production-ready applications that are powered by generative AI models which are hosted on Google's advanced, global infrastructure. Vertex AI Agent Builder is Google's platform for building and managing AI agents and applications using natural language or code.
