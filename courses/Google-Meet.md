Hello and welcome to the course. Here, we introduce you to Google Meet, Google’s video conference software included with Google Workspace. You learn how to create and manage video conference meetings by using Google Meet. You also explore how to use Google Meet features to communicate and collaborate in meetings of various sizes. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on activities, you gain confidence in using Google Meet. We encourage you to stay signed in to Google Workspace throughout the whole course, not just for the activities. Pause a video lecture or demonstration at any time, and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic that is being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer, On the Rise Bakery, as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you use Google Meet to solve a particular business challenge that On the Rise faces. Let’s review the scenario we are using as you learn about a few main features of Google Meet. In 1998, Seroja was developing a recipe for cinnamon buns. She always knew about the importance of quality ingredients, so she tested different types of cinnamon from around the world. Ultimately, she decided that Ceylon cinnamon from Sri Lanka offered the best taste and greatest value. So she developed a close relationship with a cinnamon supplier based in Kandy, Sri Lanka. This is how the On the Rise cinnamon bun was born and enjoyed great popularity due to its rich distinctive flavor. The supplier guarantees a consistently high-quality product and a fair price. As a result, On the Rise has been purchasing cinnamon from the same supplier for over 25 years. Recently, the senior leader of the organization retired. This change in management has shifted the supplier's focus and disrupted supply. Seroja feels compelled to source cinnamon from a new supplier. However, she wants to ensure that all of her bakeries produce cinnamon buns at the same level of quality and supply. Before traveling internationally to taste test, she needs to meet new suppliers to learn more about their products and supply chains. At the end of this course, you help the On the Rise team solve their business challenge by using Google Meet. Are you ready? Let’s begin.

Let’s start with the agenda. The course starts with a brief introduction to Google Meet. We then look at Google Meet in some detail. We explore different ways to open Google Meet and add people to a video conference. We also look at how to join a meeting from different sources such as a calendar event or a meeting link. In module 3, we focus on how Google Meet can help you better communicate, exchange ideas, and share resources with your team wherever they are. We also discuss how to customize the Google Meet environment to fit your needs and how to effectively use chat messages during a video conference. Then, we explore different ways to share resources, such as by using calendar invites or attachments. Module 4 expands on host management in Google Meet. We’ll talk about managing participants and utilizing interactive moderation features. We’ll also discuss how to record and live stream a video conference. Finally, as mentioned earlier, you help the On the Rise team solve their business challenge by using Google Meet. As a note, this training focuses on features for Enterprise Plus users. You might find that some features aren’t available in your Workspace edition or other features might be restricted by administrative policies. If you have questions, contact your Google Workspace administrator.

Welcome to Module 2: Using Google Meet In this module, we explore the Google Meet environment so that you can become more familiar with it. We explore the different ways that you can open Google Meet and add people to a video conference. We also learn how to join a meeting from different sources such as a calendar event or a meeting link. There are a few different ways to open a Google Meet. You can open it directly in a browser, in Gmail, in Calendar, or in the App launcher. Let’s walk through these options now.

### Video - [Start a video conference](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519766)

- [YouTube: Start a video conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IfrYCliF9I)

n this video, you’ll explore how to start a video conference using Google Meet. You’ll learn how to: Open Google Meet, Start a video conference, and Create a Google Calendar event and add a guest Now there are a few different ways to open Google Meet. Using the App launcher, you can click the Google Meet icon. When you’re in Gmail, you can use the Meet button from the sidebar. You can also use a web browser and navigate to meet.google.com or just go.meet. From the New meeting button, you’re presented with three options. You can create a meeting for later, start an instant meeting, or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. You also have the option to create a nickname for a Google Meet. Nicknames are easy to remember and can help others join meetings faster. For the purposes of this tutorial, let’s schedule a meeting in Calendar and invite a guest. After Calendar opens, an event will automatically be created. Give the event a name, and add a guest from the Add guests panel. When you add a guest to the event, a Google Meet video conference is created. This can also be done manually by clicking Add Google Meet video conferencing. Note that a Google Workspace admin policy controls the option to automatically add a Google Meet video conference to a Calendar event when a guest is added.

- [YouTube: Join a video conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5cTs7bpD48)

There are several ways to join a Google Meet video conference. You can click the Google Meet link in a Calendar invitation or an email notification in Gmail. You can also join directly from Calendar. Another option is to visit the Google Meet website at meet.google.com. Your scheduled Google Meet video conferences for the day appear on this page. Simply select the event name to join the meeting. You can also type the Google Meet link in the address bar of your browser or enter the code directly into meet.google.com. If you’re away from your computer, you can still participate in the Google Meet video call by dialing into the phone number for the meeting and entering the PIN. The phone number and PIN are displayed in the calendar event. Adding telephony details to a Google Meet is managed as an organizational policy. Dial-in information is only added if your organization has enabled telephony. You can also download the Google Meet app for your mobile device for free from the Google Play Store for Android and the Apple App Store for iPhone and iPad, which lets you create, join, and participate in Google Meet video conferences on the go.

Now, what if you want to add a person to your Google Meet video conference while it’s in progress? There are two ways to do this. The first is by sharing your Google Meet joining information. Click the Meeting details button, then click Copy joining info and paste it into an email or chat to the person you want to join you in the Google Meet video meeting. 2. Alternatively, you can use the people icon. Click the People icon, then click Add people. From here you can choose to invite people by email or you can call the person’s phone number. If you call someone, Google Meet dials the person’s phone number, and if they answer, joins them to the meeting’s audio. If your meeting has been scheduled from a Calendar event, or if your meeting has a nickname, the event title or nickname is displayed on the screen. Meeting participants outside of your Google Workspace domain might not be able to join meetings, even if they're invited. This is due to an administrator configuration. If you have questions, contact your Google Workspace administrator.

Welcome to Module 3: Collaborate in Google Meet This module focuses on how Google Meet can help you communicate better, and exchange ideas. We explore the different ways to share relevant documents with your team before and during meetings. We also discuss how to customize the Google Meet environment to fit your needs and how to collaborate effectively with participants during a video conference.

- [YouTube: Manage audio and video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvMSV4QnMqE)

In this video, you’ll explore audio and video settings in Google Meet. You’lll learn how to: Test audio and video View your google meet settings Join and use a phone for audio The following settings can be configured both before you join from the Get ready page and whilst you’re attending a meeting. Let’s start by talking about how you can customize your Google Meet settings. In the green room, the preview window shows what you are displaying to meeting attendees. Click the mic icon to mute your microphone and click the video cam icon to disable your webcam video. If you speak into your mic, the audio energy bars in the preview window move in response to your voice. Let’s look at some more settings we can view and configure. Click the More options button to see the options to Apply visual effects, Turn on captions and change settings. Before joining a meeting, you can change your background by using a provided image, video, or immersive background. You can upload your own or select styles and filters. If you prefer not to use a background, you can also choose to blur your background. In settings, you can choose your microphone and speakers if they’re different from your device’s defaults. You can also change your camera and send and receive resolutions for video. On slow internet connections, reducing video resolutions can improve your meeting experience by reducing the size of the video image to prevent stuttering and audio being out of sync with the attendee’s webcam video Clicking the Join now button adds you immediately to the Google Meet by using your current settings for audio and video. If you don’t have a mic and speakers on your computer, Google Meet has the option to use your phone for the audio features. Click Join and use a phone for audio and then choose if you want Google Meet to call you to automatically join you to the audio of the meeting or if you want to call and enter the audio PIN for the meeting.

### Video - [Use Meet controls](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519776)

- [YouTube: Use Meet controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TxedUSnJOA)

When you’re in the meeting, you can adjust more preferences by using the Google Meet controls. Here, you can mute your mic, stop your webcam video, or leave the meeting. There are also buttons to enable closed captions, raise your hand, and share your screen. Closed captions convert the audio of the meeting to scrolling lines of text that are shown within your Google Meet window. Google Meet supports captions in several languages. However, if you record a call, the captions do not appear on the recording. You can raise your hand in Google Meet through the raise hand button to let everyone in the meeting know you want to speak. After you’ve finished speaking, you can click the same button and lower your hand. You can also open the queue of raised hands to see all attendees who raised their hands ordered from first to last. Now, let’s consider presenting to a meeting. Letting the attendees see what’s on your computer screen makes sharing information easier and more engaging. In a Google Meet, you can share your entire screen, which makes your entire desktop visible to attendees, or you can share a single app window, or a single Chrome tab. Sharing a Chrome tab also shares the audio of any content on the tab, which makes it the best way to share a video from YouTube or Drive with the meeting. You can also switch to sharing a different tab by clicking Share this tab instead. When you’re presenting content, your webcam video is still visible to attendees. To start presenting, click Present now on the call controls bar and choose a presentation mode. Your Google Meet tab will say You are presenting when others can see your screen. You can click Stop presenting to end your screen share. Note that more than one person can share their screen at a time, but only the most recent share is highlighted, although the previous share is still visible to attendees.

### Video - [View and chat with participants](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519777)

- [YouTube: View and chat with participants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvohJqbmuHQ)

Now let’s talk about viewing other participants in a Meet. During your Google Meet video meeting, you can see a list of the current participants. Click the Show everyone button to expand the side panel, and see everyone’s names and Google Account profile photos. Those who are invited but aren’t in the meeting appear in the Also invited section. Google Meet automatically highlights the current speaker. By clicking on an attendee’s video thumbnail, you can pin them as the main video window. This won’t affect any other attendee’s view of the meeting. Clicking on their name in the list exposes the options to mute their mic and to remove them from the meeting. You can also manage how you view yourself in a meeting. To hide your self-view, click on yourself, and click Remove this tile. Clicking the Chat button opens the side panel to view the text chat of the Google Meet. You can chat with other participants in the meeting at any time; just know that all the meeting participants can see chat messages. If the Google Meet is recorded, the chat is also saved in a .txt file in Drive. You can use the chat in Google Meet to share links to Google Docs, websites, or other resources during the video meeting. However, the chat feature provided in a meeting is distinct from the Google Chat application. As a result, chats in Meet are temporary and only last for the duration of the meeting. Also, users who join the meeting late can’t see the previous chat history. You might also notice that Google Chat auto-creates group chats with everyone on a Calendar invite. Note: If no messages are sent, the chat is removed 10 minutes after the end of the scheduled meeting.

- [YouTube: Change meeting layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMoiz7Vx1Qk)

In this demo, you will learn how to change the layout of your Google Meet In the line with Meet controls, there’s a button for more options. More options include change layout, full screen, open picture-in-picture, apply visual effects, settings, and use a phone for audio. You’ve already learned about closed captions, settings, applying visual effects and using a phone for audio. Selecting Change layout displays the options for viewing meeting content. The default layout, Auto, lets Google Meet choose the most appropriate layout for the meeting content. Tiled displays multiple participants simultaneously in the window, along with a large tile if there is a presentation shared to the meeting. Spotlight fills the Google Meet window with the presentation, active speaker, or pinned webcam video. Sidebar highlights the active speaker or presentation and displays the remaining participants in a side panel. In the more options menu, you can also use Full screen and Exit full screen when desired. You can also multi-task while you’re in a Google Meet video call. By using Picture-in-picture mode, you can see a compact view of the video conference when you navigate away from your Google Meet tab. This function also lets you present and see participants at the same time.

### Video - [Google Calendar event options](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519779)

- [YouTube: Google Calendar event options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c0_7wuYPFs)

In this video you will learn how to: Create recurring video meetings Add attachments to a Calendar event. Add meeting notes to a calendar event First, let’s create a recurring meeting. Calendar lets you repeat events on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis. You can also select for events to reoccur only on weekdays, or choose custom options. For example, you might want to create a project review meeting that occurs on Monday and Thursday of every week for 12 weeks only. In this example, you would choose a custom recurrence. Let's choose an end date for the meeting by either choosing a date or specifying a number of occurrences. When you create a recurring event in Calendar with Google Meet video conferencing, the meeting details, including the Meet code and attachments, remain the same for each occurrence of the meeting. You can also change a one-time meeting to a recurring one by editing it. Now let’s add an attachment to a calendar event. When creating a Google Meet video meeting in Calendar, you can attach resources such as a meeting agenda, slide presentation or doc file for reference or review during the meeting. To add an attachment to an existing meeting, click the event in Calendar and then click Edit event. Click Add attachment, and then select a file from your Drive account or upload a file from your device. If you select a file from your Drive account and click Save, Calendar prompts you if the resource sharing permissions need to be modified for your guests to access it. To provide access, select Viewer, Commenter, or Editor from the drop-down in the modal, and then click Save event. Now let’s add meeting notes to a calendar event You can also create shared meeting notes from your Calendar invite. Click the event in your calendar and then click Take meeting notes to create a new Docs file. All meeting guests will have editor access to it, including guests outside of your organization. During the video meeting, all resources shared in the Calendar event can be accessed by clicking the Meeting details button and then the Attachments tab. Click any of the attachments to open them in a new browser tab.

### Video - [Use Companion Mode](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519782)

- [YouTube: Use Companion Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVKFEUklvQg)

Consider a scenario where you’re working from your office and need to join a group video conference. You go to a meeting room and see that your colleague has already joined the call by using Google Meet hardware, Google’s video conferencing device. If a team member who joins the call remotely sends a link in the meeting chat or begins a poll, you might not be able to open the link or participate in the activity because you have not joined the call from your own device. With Companion mode, you can connect to a Google Meet video call from a second screen. When you use the Companion mode, your mic is disabled to prevent issues with audio feedback. However, you can still turn on your camera to ensure that you are visible during a meeting in a large room with many participants. To join with Companion mode, access the meeting ready page for your video call, and, from the list of Other joining options, select Use Companion mode. You can also visit g.co/companion in your browser. In a hybrid work environment, some participants might join meetings in person, and others join remotely. At Google, we suggest joining meetings by using the Companion mode when you're in a conference room to better collaborate during meetings. This way you can access all of the Google Meet capabilities from your own device, like participating in polls and Q&As, sending chat messages and turning on closed captions. For more information on using Google Meet hardware and the Companion mode, go to the additional resources document included in this course.

- [YouTube: Present and share resources in meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKI2Pk3Ra_s)

When you need to share documents within a Google Meet conference, you have a few options. You’ve already learned about attaching documents to a meeting invite and sending links in the meeting chat. You can join a Google Meet video conference directly from Docs, Sheets, or Slides. This can help to facilitate a virtual brainstorming session and quickly review a document by inviting someone to collaborate and then starting a call from within the document to discuss further. To join a meeting that you received a Calendar invite for, click the Google Meet icon and select that meeting. You can use a meeting code to join or start a new meeting. If you’ve already joined a Google Meet meeting, you can open Docs, Sheets, or Slides in a separate tab and present from there. To share your screen in the meeting, be sure to click the Google Meet icon and select Just present this tab. If you prefer, you can also transfer the call to the tab you’re sharing by choosing Bring the call here. This way you can see the videos of other meeting participants in a sidebar on the screen and access meeting controls like muting yourself or raising your hand. By using the Share a link to add others option, you can also share links to video meetings and Docs, Sheets, or Slides files.

### Video - [Host controls](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519787)

- [YouTube: Host controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKtPhpwKa4c)

Google Meet has several features that hosts can use to moderate a meeting. To see your options, you can click "Host Controls". Enabling host management for a meeting, let's the host control whether attendees can share their screen, send chat messages, turn on their microphone, or turn on their video. Let's say you have a large meeting with one main speaker and over 100 attendees like a webinar, for example. You're concerned that some attendees might accidentally unmute themselves when they should not be speaking and you want to avoid any disruptions to the presentation. You might choose to prevent participants from turning on their microphones or sharing their screens. Meeting moderation in Google Meet is not limited to the meeting creator. To add a co-host, click, "Show Everyone". To open the People tab, click "More Actions" next to the person's name and then click the Add as Co-host option. Depending on your Google workspace addition, you might be able to add up to 25 co-hosts to your meetings. Also, when leaving a meeting, the main host and co-host alike can choose to either just leave the call or end the call for everyone. Aside from meeting moderation, host controls also have options to modify and track meeting access. The meeting access options let hosts decide whether to provide quick access to meetings. This specifies whether all attendees who are not added to the calendar invite must ask to join a meeting, even if they belong to your organization. When non-invited participants request to join the meeting, hosts can emit them to the meeting or deny the request. Hosts can also enable attendance tracking in meetings in live streams. At the end of a meeting, the host receives a report in their email. If the meaning has more than one host, only the main host receives the email. Similar to the other controls, Google Meet hosts can also change the settings for meeting activities. Host can decide whether attendees can ask questions by using the Q&A feature. If questions are allowed, the host can choose whether or not people can ask anonymous questions in the Q&A. We'll explore the Q&A feature more in the Engage with Participants lesson.

In this demo you will learn how to: Set video call options ahead of a meeting Add a co-host to a scheduled meeting Add breakout rooms to a meeting Let’s change our video call options before a meeting. Google Meet lets meeting organizers set their video call options before meetings start. You can decide some meeting moderation and meeting access settings ahead of time, like whether you want to let everyone share their screen or have quick access to meetings. Now let’s add a co-host to a scheduled meeting. Co-hosts can be added to meetings that are created with a Calendar event. To add a co-host to a scheduled meeting in Calendar, open the event. Click Edit event, and then click Video call options. In the Host controls tab, click the slider to enable Host management, and then click the Co-hosts tab. Enter a name or email address into the Add co-host field and select them from the autofill list. To ensure the co-hosts also receive emails for Google Meet recordings, attendance reports, polling reports, and other documents, be sure to check the appropriate box. Note: You can only add someone as a co-host if they’ve already been added to the Calendar invitation. Lastly, we will add breakout rooms before a meeting. Google Meet supports breakout rooms to divide participants into smaller groups during video calls. Breakout rooms let hosts split large meetings into smaller groups, have parallel discussions, and reconvene when they've finished. To create breakout rooms, in Video call options, click the Breakout rooms tab. To assign the participants to rooms, select the number of rooms you want and then click Shuffle to randomly assign participants. You can also drag names across the breakout rooms if you prefer to manually assign them. To change the name of a breakout room, enter the desired room name into the corresponding text box.

In module 3, we discussed how participants can chat with each other in a Google Meet video meeting. Google Meet also offers other features to engage with meeting attendees. You can click the Activities icon to open the panel. You can assign participants to breakout rooms while a meeting is in progress. You already learned how to configure them in Calendar before a meeting begins. When a meeting is in progress, you can configure breakout rooms within your Google Meet window. Google Meet also has a question and answer feature, or Q&A, that allows participants to post questions in a meeting. A host can use the host controls to choose whether to allow questions in Q&A. If allowed, anyone in the meeting can ask a question. All meeting attendees receive a notification when a new question is asked, and all of them can see it. By default, meetings are configured to allow anonymous questions. This means that the name of the person who’s asking the question is hidden from all attendees, including the meeting host. However, hosts can also choose to turn off this feature, which means that all questions will be shown with the name of the poster. All meeting participants can ask, upvote, and filter questions. Participants can also delete their own questions. Deleted questions are not viewable by general participants. However, hosts can view deleted questions. Anonymous questions are also viewable, but they omit the poster’s name. Meeting hosts and co-hosts can manage the questions asked in a meeting. They can hide a question, mark a question answered, or delete a question. At the end of a meeting, hosts also receive an email report of all of the questions that were asked in the meeting, along with the names of the people who posted them. Hosts can also create polls for participants to vote on. Like Q&As, meeting participants are notified when a poll is created and have the option to respond to a poll anonymously. At the end of the meeting, hosts are automatically emailed a report with the poll results and any questions that were asked during the meeting.

Recording a meeting can be useful. For example, you might be running a training session and want to capture the event so that others can view it. The organizer or any guest from the same organization can record a meeting. Remember, it’s always best to inform your meeting participants that the Google Meet video meeting is being recorded. To record a Google Meet video meeting, click the More options button, and then click Manage recording. Click the Start recording button, and then confirm your action in the modal that appears. When you no longer want to record, click Stop recording and confirm your action, or simply end the meeting. Your Google Workspace administrator must enable this feature. Recorded Google Meet videos are saved to the meeting organizer’s My Drive in a Meet Recordings folder. The meeting organizer also receives an email with a link to the recording. If the Google Meet was created by using a Calendar event and the recording is started at the scheduled meeting time, a recording link also appears in the event details, and the meeting participants from the same organizational unit automatically receive access to the recording. If you use Google Meet on a desktop or laptop computer, you also have the option to create an automated transcript of your meeting. You can access the options to start and stop transcription from the Activities panel. You can transcribe all or part of a meeting by using this feature. Although the Transcripts feature doesn’t let you pause, you can start, stop, and begin new transcription sessions within a single meeting. After the meeting, the host and co-hosts receive an automated email that contains a link to the transcript, which is saved as a Docs file in the meeting host’s Drive. If the person who turned on the Transcripts feature in the meeting is not a host, that individual also receives an automated email with the transcript. The retention period for meeting recordings varies based on your organization’s policies. For more information, check with your Google Workspace administrator. For meetings with less than 200 invitees, the transcript is also attached to the meeting’s Calendar event and all invitees can access it. Unlike the Recording feature, the Transcripts feature does not record the meeting chat. If you need to save chat messages, you must also record the meeting. Meeting transcripts of languages other than English aren’t accurate.

In traditional in-person environments, teams often collaborate using whiteboards, sticky notes, and other written materials. You can use Google Meet with Miro to help facilitate brainstorming sessions in virtual and hybrid environments. Miro, a third-party whiteboarding application, also works with Google Meet from a laptop or desktop computer. When opening Miro, you can sign in to your Miro account and create a board, or you can use Miro without registering. For more information on Miro, see the additional resources document included in this course.

## Business challenge

In this module, you will put everything you have learned into practice by helping our fictional Google Workspace customer solve their business challenge.

### Video - [Business challenge overview](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198/video/519797)

- [YouTube: Business challenge overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3arnJHTYMV4)

Now it’s time to put everything you learned into practice. Before you get started, let’s remind ourselves of the business challenge. In 1998, Seroja was developing a recipe for cinnamon buns. She always knew about the importance of quality ingredients, so she tested different types of cinnamon from around the world. Ultimately, she decided that Ceylon cinnamon from Sri Lanka offered the best taste and greatest value, and she developed a close relationship with a cinnamon supplier based in Kandy, Sri Lanka. With that, the On the Rise cinnamon bun was born and enjoyed great popularity due to its rich distinctive flavor. On the Rise has been purchasing cinnamon from the same supplier for over 25 years, because he guarantees a consistently high-quality product and a fair price. Recently, the senior leader of the organization retired. This change in management has shifted the supplier's focus and disrupted supply. Seroja feels compelled to source cinnamon from a new supplier to ensure that all her bakeries can produce cinnamon buns at the same level of quality and supply. Before traveling internationally to taste test, she needs to meet new suppliers to learn more about their products and supply chains. In the following activity, you use Google Meet to help the On the Rise team solve their business challenge.
