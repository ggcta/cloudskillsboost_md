narrator: Hello and welcome. In this course, you'll explore Google Drive, Google's cloud-based file storage service, part of Google workspace. Through a series of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on activities, it's our hope that you'll become more confident using Google Drive. Google Drive lets you keep all your work in one place, view different file formats without the need for additional software, and access your files from any device. We encourage you to remain signed in to Google Workspace as you complete this course, not just for the activities. You can pause the video lecture and demonstration at any time to explore and practice for yourself, helping to ensure that you understand the topics being discussed. This course follows a fictional customer called On The Rise as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you'll use Google Drive to solve a business challenge On The Rise is facing. Let's take a look at the scenario you'll use to learn a few key features on Google Drive. First, meet Saroja Malone, company co-owner of On The Rise. She has a Google Drive challenge. On The Rise bakery is known around the world for its signature cinnamon buns and whole-grain breads and rolls. Saroja wants to safeguard the bakery's highly confidential recipes from duplication by potential competitors. At the same time, on The Rise has always experimented with new flavors and ingredients to capture the interest of its customers. Saroja develops many of these recipes herself and not all of them are ready to be shared with the On The Rise bakery team. Saroja needs your help. She wants to find a solution where she can organize and manage her recipes that are under development. She also wants an easy way to share recipes with her bakers in real time. Ready to get started? Let's begin.

## Introduction to Google Drive

In this module, we will introduce you to Google Drive and discuss its main uses. We will also talk about key differences between personal and shared drives.

Welcome to Module One, Introduction to Google Drive. What exactly is Google Drive and how can it help streamline your workflow? In this module, we'll introduce you to Google Drive and explore its main uses. We'll also cover the key differences between personal and shared drives. Google Drive is cloud storage for Google Workspace where you can store files securely and access them from anywhere using any device. You can also use Google Drive to share files with your colleagues. Google Drive uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance search results for quick access to important content. Any file can be stored in Google Drive. The actual amount of storage available to you will depend on the Workspace license. Dozens of file types such as PDFs and Microsoft Office files can be previewed directly in Google Drive without installing any special software on your device. Drive also supports enormous files of up to five terabytes. Everyone with access to Google Drive will have a section labeled My Drive. My Drive represents content that you own, content that you have permission to access, and any shortcuts to both types of content. When content is created in My Drive, the creator owns the content. Owners can move files and folders, add collaborators with edit, comment, or view permission, share a link to a file or folder, delete content, and restore it from the trash. Also, files stored in My Drive inherit the permissions placed on the folder they're in. Google Drive also features Shared Drives. Selecting the Shared Drives label will show any file that you have permission to access. Creating and editing content in shared drives is identical to creating and editing content in My Drive. The main difference between My Drive and Shared Drives is content ownership. In My Drive, the creator owns the content, while in Shared Drives, the members of the shared drive own the content. Shared drives also have different roles for accessing and managing content. In addition to viewer and commenter, there are also managers, content managers, and contributors. Each role has specific abilities and permissions, which we'll explore later in the course. Google Drive can be accessed at drive.google.com on the web, or select the apps launcher while in Gmail or another Google Workspace app and select the drive icon to open it in a new tab. There are also mobile apps for Google Drive for Android and Apple devices. When you're in Google Drive, you can upload files and folders for storage, editing and sharing, create new folders, and create files for Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, Drawings, and Sites. If you haven't already done so, open your Google Drive in a new browser tab by visiting drive.google.com

## Share with Google Drive

In this module, we will look at collaborator roles and permissions and what these mean for sharing with Google Drive.

person: Welcome to Module Two, Share with Google Drive. In the last module, you learned about My Drive and Shared Drives. In this module, we'll look at collaborator roles and permissions and what these mean for sharing with Google Drive. Google Drive makes it easy to share folders with colleagues and other collaborators. As we covered previously, the owner of Google Drive content is the person who created it. Others can be added as an editor, commenter, or viewer when you're sharing a folder. As collaborators are added, you can optionally notify them via email. Editors can add, move, and delete folder content. Editors can also change permissions and share the folder. Commenters can view the files and leave comments and replies but cannot change, move, or delete any files. Viewers can only view the folders' contents. You can also give viewers and commenters temporary access by setting an expiration date with a calendar picker. You can change and assign permission at any time or revoke it entirely. There might be times when you want to share just a file and not all the files in a folder. With Google Drive, you can share files using the same permissions as sharing a folder: viewer, commenter, and editor. Select Share to view your collaborators and their permissions. Permissions can be changed at any time, including removing collaborators entirely or transferring ownership of the file to another editor. Selecting the Share with people settings icon exposes additional options that are enabled by default. For folders and files, the editors' ability to change permissions and share can be removed, and for files, you can also remove the ability of viewers and commenters to download, print, and copy the file. To share a file or folder, right click on it and select Share at the top right of the list. Share with a specific person by typing their name or email address and choose a role. Collaborators can also be added via Google group using the group's email address. All members of the group receive the same permissions when a file or folder is shared this way. Using Google Groups to grant permissions can be effective because it removes the need to constantly manage sharing settings at the file level. As new people join the group, they're automatically granted access to the files they need, and as others leave, their access is automatically revoked. Folders can also be shared via a link. The default link access can be set by your organization via a policy. Link sharing is disabled by default. To get a link, click the Get link icon and then Copy link. The link is now in your clipboard. When link sharing is enabled, the link can be copied and sent to collaborators or added to a document or website. The link sharing scope can be restricted allowing access only to specific people, people within your organization, and anyone with the link. You can change the scope to suit your own sharing requirements. If you want to restrict access to specific people and groups, you can set the permissions for each person and group in the list individually. If you make the link available to everyone in your organization, or make it public, you set a permission for the sharing scope, which can be viewer, commenter, or editor. You can also specify whether the folder is searchable in Drive by people in your organization when link sharing is enabled. Files can be shared in the same way via a link. A file can be shared via a link within your organization by choosing the name of your organization.

## My Drive

In this module, you will learn how to upload files and folders in My Drive and work across file types. We will also discuss how you can easily view, arrange, organize, modify, and remove files in My Drive.

### Video - [My Drive](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/199/video/528720)

person: Welcome to Module Three, My Drive. In the last module, we looked at how you can share content in Google Drive. In this module, you'll learn how to upload files and folders in My Drive and work across file types. We'll also discuss how you can view arrange, organize, modify and remove files in My Drive. Remember, everyone has their own storage area which is known as My Drive. To create a new folder, go to My Drive, select New, and then select Folder from the menu. You can also right click on any open area in the files list or on the My Drive label and select New Folder from the menu. Folders can be nested and permissions in folders are passed to any content within them. To store existing content in Google Drive, you can upload files and folders from your device, select New and then File Upload to browse your device for files. Select one or more files and then select Open to upload them to Drive. For folders, select New and then select Folder Upload to browse your device for folders. Select a folder and then select Upload to upload it to Drive. Multiple files can be uploaded in this way. However, you can only upload one folder at a time. Microsoft Office files like Word, Excel and PowerPoint can be stored in Google Drive and edited natively in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides respectively. By default, any Microsoft Office files uploaded to Google Drive remain in their original format. Later, they can be opened and a copy saved to the appropriate Google format. Alternatively, you can automatically convert Microsoft Office files to the appropriate Google Docs editor format as they are uploaded. This is enabled from your Drive settings page. Remember that files for Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings do not count toward your drive storage. Other file types do. Although there are many benefits to working in the cloud, you may want to download a file or folder to your device. Exporting your data is easy with Google Drive. To download a folder, right click on the folder name and choose Download. Drive will compress the contents of the folder into a zip file with the same name as the folder and download the zip file to your device. On your device, you can unzip the folder to access its contents. Any Google Docs Sheets or Slides in the folder automatically convert to Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint formatted files respectively. To download an individual file, the process is the same. Right click on it and choose Download. Drive will convert any Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files to Microsoft Office formats before it downloads to your device. Remember that, when you download, you're making a copy of the files, so any changes made to the downloaded copies will not be reflected in Google Drive.

person: In addition to My Drive and Shared Drives, Shared with Me shows content owned by another person and that your account has view, comment or edit permissions. To access files and folders that other people have shared with you, select Shared with Me from the list of labels. If Quick Access is enabled, cards with the names of collaborators that have shared files with you will appear along with the two most recently edited files you have access to. Recent is a chronological view of your content from most recently viewed or edited files with sections for today, yesterday, earlier this week, last week, earlier this month, and so on. If you have never opened a file, it will be listed under Never. Files and folders can be starred so that they can be easily found later. The trash holds content that has been removed from Drive. We'll discuss this further shortly. The Storage view shows content in order of size from largest to smallest by default. To take advantage of Google AI and machine learning to surface important content, My Drive and Shared with Me have quick access sections. Quick Access in My Drive shows files that have been opened or edited frequently or recently. In Shared with Me, Quick Access shows collaborators that have shared content with you in cards with the files they have added to Drive or edited recently. In each view, the default view of your content is grid view with the list of the content with a section of folders, and then thumbnails of files in alphabetical order. To reverse the order of the sort, choose the arrow next to Name at the top of the list. Or to switch the list to a different type of sort, select Name and choose Last Modified, Last Modified by Me, or Last Opened by Me. To see more information about a file or folder, select it in the files list and select View Details in the top right of the files list. The Details panel will open to the right of the files list with a thumbnail preview image of the file. The owner and any collaborators will appear below the thumbnail image along with any link sharing permissions. Other information listed includes size, storage used, location, modified date, and by, creation date, and details about other permissions like ability to download and print for viewers. Select the Edit Description button to add tags, additional file information or other metadata to assist you and your collaborators with locating the content during a search. Select the Activity tab to view history from the newest changes to the file to the oldest including the initial creation, edits, renaming, and sharing permission changes made and by whom.

Right-click on any file or folder in your file list to open the options menu. In addition to the menu, the same options will appear at the top right of the file list when you select a file or folder. Files and folders can be moved easily. Right-click on the file or folder, select Organize, then Move. When prompted, use Suggested, Starred, or All locations to specify which folder the file or folder is to be moved to. Tip! If you open the destination folder before starting the move process, it will appear at the top of the Suggested locations list. The destination can be any folder where you have editor rights. A new folder can also be created as the destination. You can also drag and drop files and folders onto another folder to move them. Right-click on any file and select Make a copy to make an exact copy of the file wherever it is located in Drive.

- [YouTube: More My Drive features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJIZti6IqTY)

Shortcuts are links to files or folders that allow content to be organized into multiple places in Google Drive. Right-click on a file or folder and select Organize, and then Add shortcut. When prompted, use Suggested, Starred, or All locations to specify which folder the new shortcut is to be created in. The same tip for moving files and folders applies here too. By opening the destination folder before creating the shortcut, the folder will appear at the top of the Suggested locations list. To create a shortcut in a folder, you must have permission to access it. Anyone with access to the folder where the shortcut is created will be able to see it, but they will still need access to the original file or folder to access it. If the original file or folder is deleted, moved to the Trash, or your permissions are revoked, the shortcuts will no longer work. A Workspace in Google Drive is a way for you to group files together for quick access. Perhaps you are working on a project where files are spread across other team members' personal My Drives and also some Shared Drives. You can create a Workspace in your My Drive from the Workspaces view. The Workspace will have shortcuts to all of the files that you need for the project. They can be grouped based on a project, a theme, or actually for any context or reason. Files can be added to a Workspace from My Drive, Shared with me, or Shared Drives. Right-click on a file, select Organize, then Add to Workspace. Select the applicable Workspace from the list of Workspaces you’ve created. Google Drive also applies machine learning to suggest which files to add to the existing Workspace and will even recommend new Workspaces over time. To delete a file or folder, right-click on it and choose Move to trash. The content will be moved to the Trash label. Alternatively, you can drag a file or folder to the Trash label. Content added to the Trash will be deleted after 30 days. To view the content, select the Trash label. The default view of the Trash has content removed from My Drive. Select the dropdown Trash from My Drive to change the view to the Trash for any Shared Drives you are a member of. To permanently delete all of the content in Trash, select Empty trash. To permanently delete an individual file or folder, right-click on it and choose Delete forever. Collaborators will lose access to any files or folders that are permanently deleted. If you delete a file that you do not own from your drive, it is removed from your My Drive but it is not deleted. You can also return content in Trash to its original location in Drive by right-clicking on it and selecting Restore. Having strong search capabilities is essential as the number of files and folders stored in Google Drive increases. To search for content, select Search in Drive. Recent searches will appear along with options to search by content type, collaborators, and modification. Selecting a collaborator's name will show a list of files owned by that person. Selecting a content type like documents will show a list of that type of file. Selecting Modified allows you to limit the time range of modified documents. Drive will show results as you type a search word or phrase returning results based on the title and the contents of files and folders. To narrow your search, select the Advanced Search icon located to the right of the Search in Drive field. You can choose the criteria you need in order to filter your search results. To limit a search to the contents of a specific folder, right-click on the folder and select the option that allows you to search within the current folder. If you use Google Docs, Slides, or Sheets, you know that you can add comments and action items to these files. To find comments that require your attention without opening up these files individually, use the Follow-ups filter in Advanced Search. Next to Follow-ups, use the dropdown to select Comments assigned to me only. The results will include all of the files that have comments assigned to you, with the number of items next to the name of the file in the list.

## Shared drives

Shared drives are shared spaces in Google Drive for sharing content with a team. In this module, we will look at how to organize, manage, and share folders and files using a Google shared drive.

### Video - [Shared drives](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/199/video/528730)

- [YouTube: Shared drives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECap2fnCqxE)

Welcome to Module Four: Shared drives. Shared drives are shared spaces in Google Drive for sharing content with a team. Instead of a single person owning the files and folders, the content in a shared drive is owned by the team. As people join and leave a team, the content remains accessible in the shared drive. Shared drives have more collaborator roles and more options for granular access to files and folders. Common use cases for shared drives include project file repositories, templates, employee onboarding, training resources, and other scenarios where the entire company needs access to the same files. In this module, we'll explore how to organize, manage, and share folders and files using a shared Google Drive. Please note that shared drives are only available for eligible work or school Google Workspace accounts, not personal Gmail accounts. To create a shared drive, select the shared drives label. Select New and give the shared drive a name. Select Create to save the new shared drive. A theme is automatically assigned to the shared drive. This appears above the name of the shared drive in the grid view and as the thumbnail image in the list view. To change the existing theme, double click on a shared drive to open it. Select the name of the shared drive to open the options menu. Hover over Change Theme and choose Pick From Gallery to browse the theme gallery, or choose Create Custom Theme to choose your own image from Google Drive. The best images for themes are rectangular banner style graphics. To add members to a shared drive, open the options menu for the drive and select Manage Members. In the manage members card, type the name or email address of the person you want to add as a member. Drive will offer suggestions as you type. Choose a role for the new member: viewer, commenter, contributor, content manager, or manager. Next, choose whether to notify the new member along with a custom message and then select Send. Alternatively, if you're not sending a notification, select Share. A Google Group can be used as a member which assigns permissions to all the members of the group. Shared drive permissions are more granular than the options available when sharing files or folders from My Drive. At a high level, it's important to know that managers have full access to the shared drive and can change its settings, along with managing members and the creation, organization, and deletion of content. Content managers can perform most file level tasks, except permanently delete content. Contributors can create but not organize content. commenters can only provide comments, and viewers can only view content. To manage membership of a shared drive you must be assigned the manager role. Managers can add or remove members and change their access level. To change a member's access level, right click on the shared drive and select Manage Members. Select the content role assigned to the member and choose a new role from the drop down menu. To remove the member, select Remove. Managers, content managers, and contributors have permission to create new files and folders in the shared drive. They can also move files and folders from My Drive to the shared drive. The process to create and upload files and folders to a shared drive is similar to that for your My Drive. A file or folder created in a shared drive will inherit the permissions of the shared drive and can be viewed and edited by members subject to their role. To move a file or folder within the shared drive, right click on the file or folder to open the drive browser to choose the destination for the content. A new folder can be created as the destination. Select Move to transfer the file or folder. You can also drag and drop files and folders onto another folder to move them. Right clicking on a file or folder also provides an action to delete the file or folder or drag the content and drop it on the trash label. Each shared drive has its own trash and content is permanently removed from the trash after 30 days. To restore a deleted file or folder, right click on it and select Restore.

Welcome to Module 5: Templates. To ensure consistency when creating content and to save time when creating the same document repeatedly, you can use a template. Templates can be created from Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms. In this module, you'll learn how to create and use templates as well as how to save and search for them in Google Drive. The template gallery has general templates provided by Google for documents like project proposals, meeting notes, timesheets, consulting proposals, and more. Each Google editor type (Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms) has its own template gallery. To open the gallery from My Drive or a shared drive, select New, hover over the menu arrow of the applicable Google editor type, and select From a template. A gallery opens in a new browser tab. The default view will be the General tab of your gallery. To see templates created by people in your organization, select the name of your organization to the left of the General tab. To use a template, select the thumbnail preview of it. A file will open in a new browser tab pre-populated with the content from the template. If the file is created in a shared drive, the members will have access to it according to their permissions and role. Edit the file using Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms. The default title of the new file is the same as the template name, so be sure to rename it.

## Google Drive tools and options

Google Drive offers several additional tools, add-ons, and options that can be enabled in order to meet your needs. In this module, we will talk about some of these options, including offline viewing, Drive File Stream, and the Google Workspace Marketplace.

person: Welcome to Module Six, Google Drive Tools and Options. Google Drive offers several additional tools, add-ons, and options that can be enabled to help meet your needs. In this module, you'll see some of these options including offline viewing, Drive File Stream, and the Google Workspace Marketplace. It's possible to work in Google Drive without an active internet connection. To make your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides available offline on your device, you must initially be connected to the internet and accessing Google Drive from the Google Chrome web browser. Start by signing into Chrome with your Google Workspace credentials, then go to Settings for Drive and check the box for offline. You may be prompted to install the Google Drive offline extension for Chrome from a Chrome Web Store. It's free and installs with one click. To make a particular file available offline, right click on the file in the Files List and select the slider next to Available Offline. This allows Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint files to be viewed and edited offline. Any changes made to the file while offline will sync when internet access is restored on your device. Google Drive File Stream allows you to work from your desktop with files stored in the cloud. The files are available on demand, which means they don't require space on your device's storage, nor do they require an enormous amount of bandwidth or download time. This feature allows you to choose which files and folders are stored for offline access. There are Drive File Stream applications for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. The ability to use Drive File Stream is set by an organizational policy so it might not be available to everyone. To install Drive File Stream, select Settings on the Google Drive page and then Get Drive for Desktop from the menu. Choose Download for Windows or Download for Mac and follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation. On Windows, a new drive called Google Drive File Stream will be created and visible in Windows File Explorer. On Mac OS, a new drive called Google Drive File Stream will be created in your user directory and visible in Finder. An icon for Drive File Stream will appear in the taskbar tray on Windows and on the menu bar on Mac OS. To access Drive File Stream settings, select the icon. Choosing any file from your new Drive File Stream drive will open it in the app that it's associated with. Drive File Stream also supports real time presence when editing Microsoft Office files. If an Office file stored in Google Drive is shared with a collaborator who also has real time presence enabled, you will be able to see whether someone is changing the file. Drive File Stream also allows you to work with files using your device's native file management features and installed apps. Files in Microsoft Office formats will open automatically in the appropriate app. images will open in your device's default image viewer and PDFs will open in the viewer installed. Files and folders can be organized in Drive from File Stream, and new files and folders can be created or existing files and folders added to Google Drive via drag and drop. If a folder of files is added to Drive File Stream, the entire contents of the folder will be uploaded to Google Drive. Content added to existing folders and shared drives using Drive File Stream will inherit the permissions of the folder or shared drive in Google Drive. To change the settings for Drive File Stream, select the Drive File Stream icon in the taskbar and then select the gear icon. To temporarily disable sync, select Pause Syncing. To proceed to the additional settings, select Preferences. In the Settings window. You can switch Google accounts or disconnect your account. By default, Drive File Stream will launch during system startup, but it can be disabled in the Settings window, as can the real time presence in Microsoft Office, In Windows, the default drive letter can be changed from G to any other available drive letter. Google Drive supports numerous third party apps called add-ons. Add-ons are listed in the Google Workspace Marketplace, an online store for applications that work with Google Workspace. For example, Google Docs doesn't have a built-in mail merge feature, but several apps in the Google Workspace Marketplace can enable mail merge in Google Docs. There are add-ons related to productivity, communication, accounting, legal, marketing, task management, and many more.
