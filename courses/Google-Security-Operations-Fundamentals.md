[Music] video One introduction to the unified security operations platform at Google Cloud our mission is to help organizations transform cyber security with Frontline intelligence expertise and AI powered Innovation nowhere is this needed more that in security operations SE Ops where understaffed and overwhelmed security teams struggle to defend against a threat landscape that is growing in volume and sophistication often with tools that were designed in the precl era we believe that successfully defending against modern threats requires modern thinking and modern solutions this is why we've taken a fresh look at what threat detection investigation and response tdir can be with Chronicle security operations this course will take you through how this unified Security operation is constructed chronical security operations is designed to allow organizations to retain and analyze unfiltered data at Google scale and speed this enables security teams to more quickly detect and investigate threats faster we recognize that for organizations to remain ahead of threats they must go beyond just collecting data as it can take security teams far too long to find what's truly relevant or they face gaps in the information that's available to search and analyze with our new unified experience for chronicle Sim and Chronicle sore we can better provide Rich context and easy pivoting between alerts cases investigations and playbooks in a single console for more streamlined and integrated tdir experience every Alert in chronicle secops is now grouped into a case to consolidate related alerts and provide access to relevant enrichment to help security teams make quicker decisions with this new platform you will see a combination of the traditional security incident and event management capabilities this includes collection of data enrichment and correl and detection and will flow into the traditional security orchestration Automation and response or sore capabilities this includes the ability to triage and prioritize alerts investigate them in a single pane of glass with streamlined case management and carefully curate response actions this is all accomplished using a beautiful visual Playbook Builder and over 300 plus Integrations to Common security tools layered on top of all of this is applied threat intelligence ATI this takes the three best ATI sources in the world virus total for crowdsource Intel mandant threat Intel for ground truth of attacks and breaches and Google Cloud threat Intel with groundbreaking research on threats impacting Cloud customers and Beyond this is Intel that is fully streamlined and operationalized in your workflows we will see examples of duet AI powerfully assisting workflows across this new platform here is a quick overview of how this platform looks you will find features that you've traditionally found in a Sim or in a sore but now under one interface the menu on the left side will be your navigation and in this course we will go through a lot of these sections one of the key pages will be the cases page where a lot of our workflow will begin the investigation section gives you the ability to start all kinds of searches the detections tab is where you will manage all the different detections that will trigger alerts in this new platform any detections created here will be correlated and packed into our cases response is where we tie together the action to answer questions like what happens when we receive an alert what is the Playbook that it goes through what are the Integrations that we have configured what are the jobs running and lastly what are the various actions that we can configure through our integrated development environment or ID dashboards will allow us to build customizable reporting around data in our system data ingested in our Sim or cases managed through our sore and we can build out and automate that reporting incident manager is the place we will go when we've determined an incident may be occurring it provides a digital war room like experience where many people can collaborate to resolve a specific situation Marketplace provides us with easy access to 300 plus Integrations from various products and vendors as well as powerups use cases and other productivity add-ons lastly the setting section is where admins can configure the rest of the platform follow the upcoming videos in the series to learn about how to utilize the power of this platform in managing your security operations we're excited to have [Music] you

## Investigation

Overview of the investigation module - Cases, Alerts, Views and Playbooks

[Music] introduction to investigation working with cases in this video you will learn how to use Chronicle as your investigative workbench for this purpose let's walk through a scenario you are a senior Analyst at simol corporation that is investigating a high sever alert symbol is under attack or is it let's confirm or deny by looking at the most recent case assigned to you let's start by looking at the cases page it's very likely that this will be the main area where you spend your day but through the side menu you will also have access to a number of other functions that are available to you the default screen for each role can be customized by A Min ministrators in order to optimize their workflow for some they want to land on cases for other dashboards Etc in the current instance you see a lot of menus this is because we show the typical view of an admin you may see fewer or more tabs depending on your permissions first when you're in cases you can customize your case view by using filters you can build any filter or select from a predefined set of filters such as the critical cases filter or the cases assigned to me filter to see how our filter behaves or to edit it click on the icon next to the filter and select the edit button next to critical cases great this filter is straightforward designed to narrow down cases based solely on those that through data enrichment or automation have been deemed critical we can easily edit this filter to make it more specific by adding more criteria adjusting the time frame environment or status or even further narrowing with a logical operator like and or or for now let's save this filter and continue our investigation as we briefly examine the case in the leftand navigation bar we can see that it is named suspicious macro activity which corresponds to a rule triggered by ingested logs in chronicle Sim that match the rules criteria the case contains one alert and has a pending action for us to address cases store all information revent to our investigation but where do they come from well in rare cases they can be manually created they can also be simulated for your testing purposes but most commonly they are generated by a connector to a detection technology such as Sim or EDR in our case certain chronical Sim detections generate cases and this is one of those cases in this case to make matter simple we only have one alert but in cases where similar alerts are produced in a short time window those alerts can be grouped to ensure you don't waste time this simple feature case grouping can often lead to 50 to 60% or even more reduction in case loads here is an example of that in this remote failed login case that Consolidated three similar alerts but let's go back to the original case we were investigating to delve deeper into it let's click the arrow icon to collapse this menu tab and give ourselves more space we find ourselves in the case overview tab our case overview tab gives us a broad summary of all the alerts for this case and the other key pieces of information this view can be modified by administrators of the account to customize what is shown to us here you can see the duet AI features in action highlighted is the AI investigation widget which provides AI generated case summary and suggestions based on the specific use case and the way in which the case should be handled the widget classifies the case in terms of how much attention the case might require summarizes the alert data for a better understanding of their threats and provides recommendations for next steps to be taken for Effective remediation the classification summary and recommendations all include an option to leave feedback as to the level of the a accuracy and usefulness in this situation I see that this case may require a high level of attention based on a number of indicators including the suspicious website used to download this which can be an incredible productivity boost for our current analysis the alert widget at the top tells us that two events are grouped with this event and that this Alert in particular is a high priority there's a Playbook that's already been attached called malware detection this Alert in particular doesn't have an SLA but it should judging from the severity and priority of this alert let's make a quick note about that now for our sock manager to fix I can tag my administrator by name or simply by stating at administrator for better workflow I can also assign tasks directly from here so that my administrator will be able to get to this particular action item through built-in tasks great we tagged our sock manager to update this let's investigate a little further our Playbook added a helpful description directly from our rule to make it easier to summarize but we can go ahead and edit this description to be the executive summary of this investigation now we could add as many notes here as we like but thankfully we don't have to manually put a play byplay on every single action we do in the case summary because we have a chronological record Rec of the activity kept in the case wall here you can see the comment and the case task I left for the administrator as well as the history of all the actions that our playbooks and automations did this is a good place to track the chronicle see what we did there of our case now let's go back to the overview and talk about entities these things highlighted here or in our graph here's how they work we get a detection or an event from somewhere in in this case our Sim this data contains all kinds of fields in all kinds of formats with all kinds of field names Source IP SRC IP principal IP principal host name Etc and it will be a huge burden on our sore admins to manually configure that for every type of product and enrichment just for our playbooks to work this is why Integrations in our Marketplace come with these mappings out of the box and normalize everything to a model of entities the integration is aware of that model and is able to extract our critical entities in simple terms you will automatically get extraction of main objects of interest in an alert things like host names IP addresses or usernames as well as indicators of compromise such as file hashes potential malicious domains Etc we can see there are a number of different entities highlighted for this case with Steve Watson being the initial user involved this way we can plug and play our enrichments ask Chronicle Sim what else did the user do or who else visited this domain ask virus total and mandiant TI what we know about the domains accessed Etc this also works with our automation if Steve Watson is our host and we want to contain it using our EDR such as crowd strike for example we can do so right here here you can see a more visual representation of these entities in the entities graph for this particular case this graph showcases not only the different entities but the possible relationships between them we can look at a more detailed view of this by clicking the explore button in the top right corner the left hand side of this view lets us look at all the group alerts for this case and their Associated entities since this case has only one alert alert only one is listed below this it shows us the events leading up to the alert in this question it looks like two events took place first a malicious URL was visited and then a process was launched we can view a timeline of the events and alerts for this case and see what indicators were driven by which events in our example the network connection data gave us details of the IP address the UR L and then once our process launch occurred that filled in the dots for things like process name and process ID and process hashes which we can further enrich using our Intel sources the blue dots on the timeline show us the events as they took place in chronological order let's return to the case overview and quickly recap before we move on to investigating the alerts in summary cases contain one or more alerts and are an easy way for us to contain our work they include data from our alert details we've manually inputed or automatically extracted critical entity information that can then enhance her enrichment and automations as well as complete timeline that can contain things like actions comments tasks and much more in our next video we will go into the alert View and first continue our [Music] investigation

[Music] video three introduction to investigation working with alerts views and actions in this video we continue looking at our case View and we will dig into how to investigate and alert the first thing we see on this view is a pending action awaiting our input this action in particular is named investigate further so far in our investigation we've gathered a lot of information but I think we need more data before we can make a determination on what remedial action needs to take place click on the respond button the tab shows us all the entities involved and at the bottom an action for us to complete complet the action is asking whether or not we want to investigate this case further or immediately escalate we don't have enough information yet to know that so let's select investigate other activity on the host this action will use the built-in Chronicle action in The Playbook and send a query to our Sim environment that pulls other data from The Host this query is optimized for this particular Playbook and that can all be configured in the Playbook if successful we'll see the action executed we can now check our case wall for results where we see details of the execution the case wall will contain our comments but also execution details of any actions such as the results of the query if we go back to our alert view we will find a much more pleasing view of that with a new widget for our udm query scroll down so we can see what took place here this query in particular we'll search the possible pedabytes of data in our SIM for the suspicious domain many good news.com talk about a needle and a haystack by reviewing the events here we discovered that not only did Steve Watson trigger an alert with this URL but so did a machine named micross PC in a typical scenario we may be tempted to open our notebook or spreadsheet and jot this information down for further investigation here we can go a lot smarter than that our Playbook is actually configured to automatically add our new entity found in this case micros PC to the alert the case and the investigation our security team engineered this in the response playbooks to happen every time this type of search is run on this type of event you can see how Mike Ross's machine just showed up in our graph this way critical outputs of our work become contained in our case as entities for example should we decide that this is malicious and we want to contain the affected end points this now becomes a click of a button all the relevant endpoints are going to be tagged and we won't end up forgetting something or wrangling notes but let's say you happen to find another affected host or user in the course of this investigation you can always add this as an entity to the case through the manual add entity now what will the analyst see in the alert view good question the alert view is entirely customizable and not only can each Playbook Define a different view but you can have different views for different roles so for example a tier one analyst gets the most important information and a tier three may get a lot more information the idea here is that based on the type of alert you will see different information if you're getting a fishing report domain reputation may be important this is configured through widgets and we will see a few examples of these widgets over the course of this training let's look through a few examples once again again we were looking at our already familiar graph view while it may appear redundant this view is different from the case overview as this is only for entities for this alert verse all the entities for the entire case the events info is another great built-in widget that gives us more information and a better visual of the events for this alert this information is stitched together from logs in our Chronicle Sim if you want to see the events themselves you can browse the events tab which gives you access to the raw data of the event you can look at highlighted fields or choose which field to highlight this is also a very nice access point to the mapping section that takes our Raw event data and Maps it nicely to our graph if you hover over you can see exactly why this field is mapped to our host name and it shows up nicely in the graph and entities but enough about this configuration that is a more advanced topic for now it's good to know that it exists another tab that you should probably be aware of is the playbooks tab that just shows the playbooks that are running associated with this case since this is a malware case our malware Playbook is executing and you can see the decision we made to further investigate and the corresponding searches and actions it took once again playbooks provide a more advanced topic of discussion but for now what you should know is that each step of this Playbook can be manual or automated each step step can grab information that can then be presented to the user as data points like in a widget or as a decision like the action we were asked to initially take but events and playbooks are often tabs for more technical users and we will review them in our next video let's get back to our overview tap the similar cases widget shows us cases that are either gathered by the associated alert or by a triggered event it further shows a match for similar entities or triggers from Rules coming from Chronicle Sim similar cases are a great way to provide our analyst with reference points so they can get ideas for their investigation the host events Trend section is an example of stats we can pull to determine if anything suspicious has taken place with this Host this is a great place for all these Sim searches we do over and over again let them play in the background and just get the results ready to go the moment you open the widget we have so far enriched data with our belt and sore cases and with data from our Sim and we were able to discover some correlations but where you really multiply productivity gains is when you interrogate products and Intel sources that you normally may need to swivel chair into often just to get some information or perform an action and you end up doing the same search or activity over and over again with the built-in Integrations and the ability to velop our own Integrations Chronicle sword truly amplifies the speed at which you can connect your security products there's an extremely rich Marketplace full of all kinds of connectors that you can configure install and extend today we will walk through two of the most powerful and common out-of-the-box Integrations mandiant threats intelligence and virus total here are some examples of these Integrations in action mandant TI immediately tags the malware used here with the threat actor coni we can pull from our Intel database everything Mandy and researchers have provided about coni in this example we can see that we're really talking about ransomware written in C and C++ that immediately should trigger our suspicion luckily our Playbook knew that which is exactly why this entity is tagged as red and as suspicious we can click into any of these to browse the mandian advantage platform for other details and information for now we have what you could call a Smoking Gun and it's time to take action quickly once we've decided to contain this we can also start looking into virus total intelligence which tags our respective URLs and domains as suspicious it also gives us invaluable information of two different things that were seen in the wild related to this attack such as this URL pattern here or potentially the presence of a compressed parent called test file.zip all these will be good to look into eventually but we've probably seen enough to confirm further actions we will refer to the miter attack enrichment it should be appropriately tagged with the proper miter attack IDs and categories you can see here we have suggestions such as training the user which is a tomorrow problem but also containing execution which is exactly what we need to do right now wow we've learned so much so let's do a quick recap we know that the user Steve Watson somehow accessed a malicious URL many good news.com which is part of the malare campaign according to mandiant and virus total information after Steve access the URL an execution took place for a malicious file that according to mandiant is related to the KY ransomware campaign but our powerful Sim detection caught it our sore enrichment elevated it and our analyst was able to respond in time through our use of the udm Search widget we learned that Not only was Steve Watson affected by this but so was Mike Ross review of the similar cases widget tells us that this detection for this specific URL has taken place before we've concluded the very basis of the case management and the alert overview in our next video we will give a highlevel overview of some of the more technical things you can do with the case like look at source events configure mappings explore playbooks and [Music] more

[Music] introduction to cases getting the details events playbooks manual actions hello and welcome to the Google SE Ops training in this video we're going to look into more of the advanced functionality of the case management system in chronical sore we've discussed how cases consist of one or more alerts each alert can also consist of one or more events as we've seen here we've mentioned before that these events correspond to events seen in our source system in this case it's just generated from our Chronicle Sim but it could be any system that generates notable events an EDR IDs even an email mailbox with fishing reports from your users the alert we've been looking at are constructed of two events alerts coming from Chronicle Sim will immediately offer the option to see the originating rule showcasing the power of the integrated Sim and sore platform the two events in our case are simply these two events starting with our Microsoft Excel launch event here with the raw log on the left and the normalized log on the right notice for a moment the fields marked with e those are the fields that are already enriched by chronic in this case the originating log only comes with a proprietary crowdstrike ID but the system is smart enough to take into account other logs that Stitch this information case without that the correlation for our detection simply wouldn't have been possible our network has no idea what a crowdstrike ID is it doesn't even have an idea of what a host name is but Chronicle took these disparate events and built a stitch together story out of them on the network side we took a log that only has an IP address and enrich the other fields like host name but also things like geolocation enrichment for our current slide powered by an intelligent Google IP database our detection bundles these two individual events or logs and adds additional detection level metadata such as rule name or miter Technique we now have access to every possible field displayed with detection level Fields such as the miter technique ID event level Fields like a username or the glocation these are now fields that our sore can work with back in our case click on The View more section and you will see the complete list of these events including the exact same fields we looked at so now our tech savvy analyst can get to the source information of every single event once again Sor has a nice feature of adding highlighted Fields where we can pick and choose the fields that may be of top interest now this will typically use the field naming convention of the source product for chronicle Sim you will see names like principal host name or Target hostname for crowd strike or other Solutions similar Fields will have different names and we simply can expect analysts to remember all of that this is where ontology comes into play and where we can easily extract and enrich entities from raw Source fields for instance all I want to know is what is my source host name which Chronicle can handle easily let's go through an example if I click on the gear icon then I can see the visual representation of this mapping if you remember our entity graph looked a little bit like this but here you can also see the manual configuration you can define a mapping on the vendor level Chronicle the product level in this case Chronicle custom rules or the event type level in this case process launch most Integrations already configure a default mapping for this for example here principal unor host name is already considered the default for Source Host this is why we also saw it in the entity graph but the ability is there for you to inspect and customize as needed you can also deal with enrichment for instance a good enrichment here would be adding that crowd strike ID or IP or Mac address what this means is if we view our entity these enrichments are already coming in okay so we have a lot of data we have events alerts a bunch of fields and enrichments available to us we've extracted entities in a perfect world we do as little as possible it is the job of a good playbook to take all this information and automate everything we do over and over again if we check our EDR each time an alert comes in or we log it into our mandate Advantage portal to check an IP address this is where the Playbook will automate all that in each alert the playbooks tab shows us the full Playbook let's zoom in and see the steps we've taken so far and possible branches for this Playbook the first block is a trigger block the information to the right lets us know that it triggers when the rule suspicious downloador office is detected indicating that we have a special playbook for this kind of alert this next block is a block specifically for miter blocks are an easy way to reuse logic across playbooks this block has its nested action underneath it we can see this by reading the block flow this one first tags the case with merer receives the information for the technique detail receives the information for mitigations adds The Entity for the miter technique if it doesn't exist already and then individually updates The Entity properties with this information ending with an output block to tie it all together the next block is a virus total product block and is another block just like the block before we can follow the flow of the steps for this block and see that ultimately it is adding various enrichments from virus total to display on our alert view the next block is a chronical enrichment block and follows the same methodology as the previous block and finally a mandian enrichment block these previous blocks will add more entities and enrichments to flesh out the details of this case and also be seen in our overall alert view with their customizable blocks the action after these enrichment blocks box is the case stage assessment action actions are just what the name implies quick actions this one simply changes the case State we're done with our triage which was done automatically and now we're tagging the case with the stage assessment these stages will be important to us to be able to calculate metrics such as time to investigate and time to respond then our Playbook ends with a conditional block the condition for this block is whether or not the case has an entity that is suspicious this is a flag that any of our previous enrichments could have raised if it is not the alert can be closed and conveniently has the fields pre-populated stating that the alert is non-malicious normal behavior and a false positive however if the case is suspicious it moves to the next block which then gives our analyst a decision The Prompt asks would you like to investigate further or escalate the case this can give decisions such as investigate other activity on the host escalate to tier 3 Etc had we selected escalate to tier 3 it would have gathered all the entity information from the case and then generated an email Based on pre-filled data in this case it emails our tier three manager with an urgent subject and appends the event name for the entity on this case the content then links the case ID which it gets from the enriched entities and sends the email once this step is complete the case ass changes to tier three where they can choose to close the case however if you remember we selected to further investigate the host since the event that triggered this alert derived from the network activity that was tagged as malicious URL it would make sense for us to investigate the URL itself this query does this for us and is a great way to enable analysts who struggle with writing a query like this raw and instead need help in automating it after conducting the query The Playbook repeats a familiar multi-decision step playbooks can be very detailed or very simple depending on the external connectors and the Integrations you have it can be customized endlessly to suit your environment with custom widgets and Views while it's important that analysts are familiar with how to dig deeper these playbooks are a powerful guide to help with efficiency while the deeper dive did not lead to new insights for our investigation it was a good chance to understand understand how we built this case and understand the playbooks role in pulling those insights automatically it was also helpful in dealing with the important operational work of tagging and enforcing clear decisions let's move on to the final tab of this alert the alert graph the alert graph gives us all the entities associated with the triggered alert it is fed from our Sim detections and is intended to show possibly connected detections that may be non- alerting or sometimes connected to the left we have a summary of the graph with the entities listed below and the ability to expand each window and get more details we can also do this simply by clicking the icons on the graph itself let's click the RIS score button at the top to add that highlighted field we added earlier in this view we can see that everything derived from the rule being triggered which is named suspicious uncore downloador office and we can see there's an additional possibly related alert that we can apprehend to our investigation clicking on the website icon labeled many goodnews.org with an association to this domain we again see that both Mike Ross and Steve Watson trigger these rules and can add that on the graph by checking the box under on graph we can also click the plus icon under each icon to further expand the graph with more associations and data to keep exploring now is a good time to wrap up our video and start digging into the SIM for more advanced investigation we can do this directly from here by pivoting to the interesting events within this alert clicking on the timeline gives us ideas of searches such as give me everything you know about many goodnews.org [Music]

## Search and Detection

Overview of the seach, detection and curation capabilities

### Video - [Introduction to Search](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/971/video/486854)

- [YouTube: Introduction to Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDjYUEdqtx8)

[Music] video five introduction to search previously on this series we did a deep dive into a case and did preliminary investigation utilizing our case and alert views we determined the nature and possible impact of the attack which was a malicious payload that was was delivered through Excel downloading and executable we ended with a good idea of what happened and what the indicators were show triage using sources such as virus total and mandiant and we were able to learn enough to contain the activity we're now putting on our tier 2 tier Three hat and getting to the bottom of exactly what happened for that purpose we are in the Sim search view to continue our investigation A lot happened here with just one innocent click so let's break it down by clicking on that domain Chronicle automatically constructed a query for us as shown at the top this is known as a udm search or unified data model search and allows you to run searches across all the normalized or enriched fields in our data model you'll recall this is the same udm search we ran earlier with our Playbook widget which was helpful in our discovery of the other user affected Mike Ross however this view will give us the starting point to look at much more The Playbook that we did however was a great example of automating a rudimentary task if our analyst run this search every single time just to get the associated entities and attach them to the case why not do that automatically in the overview section below the search bar we can see enrichments about the domain that Chronicle stitch together you can also find internal enrichments such as first and last scene who is information Etc in Associated entities we find all the assets associated with this domain here we can toggle between the time range and all time we also have the virus total enrichment that will give us details from virus total.com without having to na navate out of the page continuing on with our original search we see the alerts and ioc's associated with this domain and the respective rule they launched I'm curious if there's more alerts triggered and users affected by this domain so let's expand our timeline past the default 24 hours window you can see how our timeline is populated with other possible alerts in scope that's enough of the summary section now we can take a look at the event section let's look at the events now here we can see a pool of all the events from our search right now there are only a handful of events but this search can actually pull up to a million events at a time for you to sift through we can also see a really great feature our two alerts are overlaid on top of the search this is designed to highlight things that may be notable in this timeline clicking on an event with an alert overlaid will immediately pull details about the alert for context if we expand our search time frame we will also be able to find other connections we can also see a nice mix of log sources you can see a quick indication here in the event summary the way this works is that all data is pulled in a structured way in a unified data model let's say we click on the column section here you will start getting an idea of how the udm is structured we can for example add a column for Network received bytes and that information will be displayed each log will have a number of these fields and udm will provide a normalized representation of it now you can always look at either all the fields or even the raw log so you can start slicing and dicing the data as you like in this example our raw log Has a Field called response size this will then be normalized into Network received bytes and our analyst can then use it in search remember that this is a unified data model so you can expect this field to be the same across data sources such as firewalls or web proxies for example on the left side we have our procedural filters they provide a helpful histogram of all the event fields for instance our log sources here can be crowdstrike EDR or zscaler if we notice not all of our events have a received byes field this is because some of them are DNS locks that simply don't provide this type of information we can find this field on our filters as well here for instance we can add this filter only look for events that have more than the am amount of bytes received as we're looking for a malicious payload which will likely be more than just a kilobyte or two you can see how this gets added to our search filters notice the query at the top for the moment we started off this inquiry with target. hostname equals many news.com we didn't write that query instead our pivot got us to a pre-populated query but of course we could write any query we want in in here in fact we don't even have to identify that it's target. host name Chronicle has the idea of group Fields so you can just write hostname equals many goodne news.com this will look at all the possible hosts sources destinations observers which would be things like ad servers or firewalls for example a search in quotes will indicate an exact search a search in slashes would be a fuzzy research or a regular expression let's say we're looking for any host that contains many good news the equivalent of many good news as a reject I can also add no case to look for things that may have different capitalizations the alert section of this will provide a view of only the alerts in a specific query now let's say we want to run a quick report for instance a list of all the hosts that have connected to many good news with the total number of bytes they downloaded from it for this we would go into a pivot section and very similar to an Excel or spreadsheet pivot built a pivot around specific variables let's say we want to see all the hosts here we would say Group by host name and hit apply for values we would choose network. received bytes and then summarize it by Sum because we want the totals before we finish this section let's discuss the productivity feature of search because you always want to be able to get to the search you want rapidly Chronicle search comes with a variety of features that helps you do that first you have search history where you can see your past searches and get back to a search you want this is very much like your browsing history in case you forget to bookmark something speak speaking of bookmarks this is the idea behind save searches those are things you can share if we go ahead and click save search this will go into our library where we can also opt to share it with the organization there are a number of helpful out-of-the-box searches here too that serve as a library another fantastic feature that analysts use all the time is that everything you do here events you click filters pivots is completely peral linkable so you can share the context of the view you are working on with anyone else on the team not just in saved searches but in your case and ticket management system chat or any other setup which really enhances productivity new analysts will be able to see exactly what you are seeing down to the specific event you are looking at this is very similar to sharing a URL when you are browsing the internet hopefully you see the pattern now the last feature worth noting is duet AI powered search searches are great but what if we want to craft a query here is where some of the AI features come into place we can type in human language the type of query we want for example HTTP connections that download more than 500 kilobytes this then suggests the correct search for us including all different fields we need to know this is a huge productivity boost especially for analysts new to the system that are learning the search syntax this search also indicated a hunt that generated a few different ideas for other assets impacted if we pivot on George Stanley we can initiate a new search with just the asset just skimming through the events we can tell the exact type of malware that has been lurking around only this time it was initiated by hello world. XE attackers change their indicator slightly but the pattern Remains the Same and as someone already containing an incident we want to look into this pattern and improve our detections now we're getting to the end of our video and it's time for a quick summary investigation in chronicle is mainly done through search where all of your data is available correlated normalized and enriched you have a robust search workbench with intuitive features to Define filter save share pivot and explore searches with this you can generate a hypothesis and even use the help of AI to test some of your hypotheses in our next video we'll take this a step further and build a detection [Music]

[Music] video six introduction to detections Welcome to our SE Ops training today we will continue discussing the fundamentals of Investigation detection and response with chronical SE Ops detections can be found and managed in the detections tab on the menu where you can get access to rule definitions and settings alerts and ioc's and you can also manage reference lists those are lookup lists that our rules and searches can use but being here within the sore case you can easily access the detection just by going to the alert menu and navigating to either view the detection rule or view other alerts from this rule let's click on view detection rule this brings up our custom dashboard for this rule where we can do a number of actions this is the detection view for this rule to the left we see every detection triggered for the given time range of this rule starting from the earliest to the latest clicking on expand all gives us a deeper look into the events for each detection we can use the slider to expand or contract the timeline clicking on each alert will highlight the timeline in the middle of the page giving a visual of when the alert was triggered and the distinct count of detections the information above the timeline gives information about the rule underlying it including the rule description author priority and more the menu to the right shows our procedural filters a list of all possible udm Fields with their Associated values for these detections for example clicking on metadata log type shows the type of logs that were used for these detections in this case you can see zscaler tanium and crowd strike were the log sources and you can see a histogram of how much they repeat hovering over the fields you can further narrow your search by excluding the selected field excluding others or including the field you can also search for these fields above by typing in the field you're looking for or expanding all to scroll through easier for now click the arrow next to the procedural filter and hide this redirect to the left panel and select one of the events then click the tiny icon to the right which shows an arrow with two rectangles clicking this opens the Raw log View for the log that was ingested into Chronicle in this case fanium reading this Json can be challenging and difficult to understand especially when you have thousands of these logs thankfully this data is parsed automatically into the udm fields we've been using all along by toggling the event SL entity checkbox you'll see how these fields are extracted and normalized you'll note that some of the fields have a u which means it was unenriched as it came from the log then there are other fields which are enriched denoted by a green e these fields are yet another amazing feature of using Google Chronicle by ingesting contextual data from different sources and Performing analysis on the data Chronicle can associate and Stitch together these fields onto a normalized log like this this is how for example we were able to determine that the user Steve Watson was an intern earlier while this information has been useful and informative let's return to our original task exploring the rule that triggered these detections let's click on The View Yara L button at the top right of the screen this takes us directly to the editor for this detected rule this course is aimed towards an introductory / intermediate look into using Chronicle so we'll only briefly dive into rules at the top of the page we can see that this rule is enabled when it was created its last save changes and the rule type in this case the rule type is multiple events since it triggers for both process launch and network HTTP the menu to the right shows us that this rule is live alert enabled and has a run frequency of 10 minutes below this is the Yara L retro hunt feature where we can run this rule against pass log data to search for detections we can duplicate this rule easily using the duplicate button clicking view rule detections will return us to the previous screen view versions allows us to look at previously saved versions of this Rule and even reenable them versioning also maintains the different versions of detections lastly archive is used to hide the rule and all of its versions from our rules without actually deleting the rule for the rule itself the Top Line names it in this case suspicious download Office The Meta section defines useful information we want to attach the detection almost like a description for example adding the miter attack URL field will generate this in udm form when the rule is triggered we can reuse that field on the miter attack widget we previously saw in alerts the event section is where the majority of the logic of the rules reside this rule looks for any time an event of type process launch takes place where the word excel occurs anywhere in the file path and an event type Network HTTP takes place where the target URL contains exe or is larger than 100 kilobytes Excel shouldn't really be downloading executables or large files this just expresses the correlation afterwards we see the match section which is where we Define what we're looking for and what to group the results by here we are matching events based on host name over a 5 minute window meaning we are looking for a 5 minute or less window where the first event occurred and then the second event occurred the selection below outcome attaches more fields to the result like Risk score those are fields that may not be present in the events themselves but we need in our detections this is where we can run calculations such as counting the number of events defining static variables like miter technique IDs and so on there are a number of extremely useful functions available to us in the outcome section that are subject to more advanced videos lastly condition simply says to trigger this alert when both of the events we described earlier are true let's move on to the rules dashboard the rules dashboard is a look into all the rules you have whether they are enabled disabled alerting or not it shows us the rule names with the activity for each detection over the past 4 weeks it also tells us the severity of the rule which is derived from The Meta portion of the rule as we learned earlier we have the ability to toggle alerting on or off as well as change the Live status and run frequency it lastly tells us when a particular rule has or had completed a retro hunt this is great for custom rules but what about any Google rules that can run against the data that in particular is handled in curated detections in our next video we're going to look into curated detections and how you can start building your first [Music] rule

[Music] curated detections and building your first rule hello and welcome to this tutorial on Chronicle SE Ops today we are discussing curated detections and how you may go about building your first rule curated detections is a powerful feature that essentially gives us outof the-box rules developed directly from Google Cloud threat intelligence team specifically for chronicle seops the rules are grouped by threats like Linux threats or Windows threats along with their descriptive name similar to our rules dashboard we can see if the rule is enabled or alerting is on however enablement is somewhat different here for curated detections a rule can be broad which means lower confidence or precise higher confidence broad rules are reserved for suspicious behaviors such as cron jobs reaching out to the internet that may be noisy but will be good to track anyway precise rules will contain techniques tactics and procedures or ttps that are very likely associated with known threat actors or campaigns these rules also come pre-filled with the associated miter tactic and technique which can be invaluable in helping us handle or miter attack C strategy if you remember from our investigation the miter technique for this alert was T1 1204 user execution it can never hurt to have more coverage and since we're new to writing rules but concerned with the amount of affected users from this recent alert let's see if we can find a curated detection to help us out scroll down to Windows threats and click on initial access to the right side of the screen we can see this covers both the tactic of execution and the technique of user execution not to mention malicious file however this rule is not enabled so let's take care of that now so let's select alerting only on the precise rules now if one of these rules happens to create a false positive we can easily tune them here within exclusions where we can create certain tuning criteria such as specific users or hosts that may be triggering a false positive great now we have an understanding of the logic of the rule which created this alert we are familiar with Rule's dashboards and we enabled a curated detection which should help for future threat detection so let's continue on with one of our initial tasks we wanted to accomplish when we set out on this investigation writing a rule that will more broadly alert to similar Behavior Chronicle has recently released a phenomenal new feature using AI rule generation as stated earlier sometimes udm syntax can be difficult to remember or master and it's used along with Yar L to create rules thankfully we can use AI to both generate a query and then construct a rule for us first let's describe what we're trying to query it would be something like HTTP connections that download over 500 megabytes of data and click generate query we are given the result of metadata. eventcore type equals Network HTT p and network. received bytes is greater than 500,000 let's search for the past week and see what this query finds so we can make sure it's picking up what we're looking for this was useful but required us to manually write this query and look through data to find this let's turn this into a rule click on the generate rule button and we'll see if this can be easily turned into a future alert awesome aome a rule was generated for us with all the information from this query and correctly formatted let's click on open an Editor to fine-tune this rule what is nice here is the AI feature gave it a name but also used a helpful description let's click save and then run a test below to see if our rule is working correctly test rule is equivalent to running a search and a great way to validate that all our rules are working properly great the rule worked flawlessly showing us detections thanks for watching this video and stay tuned for more videos in the SEC Ops fundamentals [Music] course [Music]

## Playbooks and Dashboards

Overview of dashboarding and data visualization

### Video - [Data Visualization and Dashboarding](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/971/video/486857)

- [YouTube: Data Visualization and Dashboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKuGP9SdKKw)

[Music] video 8 introduction to data visualization and dashboarding in this video we're going to discuss how to bring your data to life with dashboards this will be found in the dashboards tab where we can look for Sim dashboards sore dashboards and sore reports let's click into SIM dashboards this is an experience that provides the ability to slice and dice the data in your Sim in a variety of different ways we can look through some examples of that through the default dashboards that come with our Solutions our main dashboard includes metrics around ingestion throughput and alerts a sample of what an executive overview dashboard may look like with pointed metrics we can change the time filter in this dashboard and also download it as a report or schedule delivery of it downloading a dashboard gives us a number of options including format size and other tweaks if we export this to a PDF for example the system will generate the rendered result for us fully formatted if we choose to schedule this delivery to send a report to our siso for instance I can do that in a similar manner if we click the dots by the Dashboard name we can also copy the dashboard to our personal dashboards or to the shared dashboard that we're building for our organization this instant currently has no custom dashboards and we are going to work through creating one through the course of this series for this time being we can just go ahead and copy this default dashboard this will then allow us to add more widgets or deeply customize the dashboard by clicking edit this allows us to add all kinds of new widgets to this dashboard text buttons and visualizations but let's exit out of this for the moment and review some other default dashboards this is the example with Cloud detection and response that provides an executive level overview of how our Cloud detections are working and if we have the correct coverage of data parsing and detections to make sure our gcp environment is covered similarly the contacts aware detections dashboard covers our risk analytics the idea there is that risk sces are Incorporated with every detection and collected into an entity and Signal graph this highlights devices at risk that perhaps have multiple varied detections or risk factors you can see all the players we've discussed so far Steve Watson Mike Ross Etc show up on this dashboard the data ingestion and health dashboard is a critical dashboard to look at all your log sources and analyze if there's any potential issues or challenges we can also look at variances of ingestion throughput top data sources and more ioc matches is another dashboard that that highlights the matching capability in chronicle we can natively ingest various indicator feeds including mandant threat intelligence and highlight any potential assets that may be impacted rule detections tap into our detections database this is presented on this dashboard along with other top detections from that time range we can even go in and investigate this already very familiar detection lastly the user signin overview showcase is a use case of how we take just a part of the information in our case logins or signin this dashboard shows some neat ideas on how we can render this information in a variety of charts now that we've showcased some ideas you probably saw that there's a variety of data to pull from and a variety of visualizations bar charts pie charts Sparkle charts you name it let's put this in action by creating a custom dashboard let's go ahead and click on the add button and create a new dashboard we can also import a dashboard but it probably helps to start from scratch just to understand the concepts an empty dashboard will appear and we can now go ahead and edit this dashboard we can then add static tiles like text buttons and markdown we can also add Dynamic tiles which will be our visualization here we get to choose the type of data we want to work with entity graph would be our entities user hosts Etc ioc matches will be the data around threat indicators matching data in our environment that is good for some of our threat hunting dashboards ingestion metrics and ingestion stats are two tables that can help you monitor the health of the ingestion pipeline they are similar ingestion stats was the older table that has a bit more data but also data can take longer to populate ingestion metrics has simpler stats but it's fresher and Chronicle helpfully provides a combination of the two Rule detections and Rule sets allow you to do reporting on your rules and udm events act as the fire hose every single udm event normalized and enriched this will be the richest data source of event let's do a typical report what are the users with the highest number of login fails for this we will choose udm events this gives you the schema for udm including all the different fields we've used previously in Search and rules here we chose to give you a familiar schema to look at let's pick a field here such as target. user. userid that's what's called a dimension this will go into our inuse tap we also want to add a simple metric let's pick the total amount of events for each user we're not filtering events just yet so we will just select a measure called count all equivalent to the count star for those of you who know SQL lastly we will pick a visualization let's start with a simple table and click run R this will now give us all the users now remember here that we are looking at every single event a lot of these will not have a user so we may want to filter and remove events that don't have a user we will click on my filter widget here which adds users to the possible filter and chooses a condition of it's not blank this removed the blank we also probably want to filter by event type but let's show you another feature a pivot let's search for our event under score type field and instead of clicking on it directly let's click on the little pivot icon this now becomes a pivot variable and we're going to pick the NM name field because that's more human readable pressing run will now break down every user by every possible event type once again this is similar to doing a spreadsheet pivot where that becomes your column variable and you can see all the different event types this is not necessarily what we want so instead we are going to add it as a filter by clicking on the filter button and then removing the pivot we really want the user login events which show nicely in a drop down for us in this filter when we run the widget again we get the result of all our users trying to log in and who is trying to log in the most we can now save this widget and we have our very first dashboard with our very first widget there's a lot more to be done with dashboards but let's keep this video introductory thanks for watching this video and stay tuned for more videos in the SEC Ops fundamentals [Music] course

## Managing Responses

Response module overview. Playbook creation and dashboard creation

[Music] video 9 managing response and building your first Playbook now that we're coming towards the end of seop's fundamentals there are a few more topics that we should cover first let's talk about response the response section in the sore will be home to your playbooks and Integrations let's go through an example of how Integrations and playbooks work with one another in the integration setup screen you can configure an integration that is installed in our instance these Integrations can be shared or they can also apply to only a specific environment the default environment is created for every instance but sometimes multinational companies may have various security teams with different environments or man manag service providers may serve a number of internal or external clients so this is where these Integrations can be specific just to an environment here you can see all the Integrations we have configured on this instance such as our Mandan integration or Google security Command Center integration these Integrations will Define the exact parameters they need to authenticate whether it's an API keys or anything else if you are new to SAR a great place to browse is the marketplace which provides a very userfriendly experience to discovering new Integrations powerups and use cases for instance we can search for jira and install the integration which will load the entire code of the integration in our instance the little documentation widget will give us details from the Manifest including description and supported actions like download attachments or update issue as well as Jobs connectors and managers in this example the jobs will perform a bidirectional sync between sorc cases and jira and our connection will be able to automatically pull jir cases into our sore this integration isn't installed but if we want to we can just press the download button and configure it let's go back to the mandant threat intelligence integration which provides more TI orientated actions like get malware details you can see that this integration also offers predefined widgets as part of the actions these are custom uis that we can show the analyst using the documentation link you can get more details as to how each integration is configured for now let's see this in action in a Playbook with a simple example let's simulate an alert this is a very handy feature for testing where sore provides a number of simulated alerts we can choose this virus is found alert for the moment and you will see how this simulates an alert with a lot of good data but it's really just that data our entities are extracted our event and alert data is present and our duet AI may still make an educated recommendation for how to deal with this however we don't really have too much information because we don't have any playbooks assigned the last thing we will do before leaving the screen is inest as alert as a test case let's navigate to the alert we want to test with and go under the menu and select ingest alert as test case just clicking on ingest as test case creates this new case for us marked with a t for test navigating to Playbooks you'll see that playbooks are organized into folders let's create a new playbook and put this in the SE Back Ops training folder we will apply this to the default environment for the moment first we need to drag and drop a trigger which is what alerts do you want this Playbook to run on we could say all but in this case we really just want it to work on our simulated malware alert to test it we can just say contains virus on actions let's choose get inrich ioc's from the mandant threat intelligence integration again you see these widgets automatically show up for us we can then choose our ioc identifiers this can be something coming from the logs if you want to deal with raw fields for now we will choose to use our entities and just select all file hashes for now we want to run that enrichment we need to pass a variable which we can choose from this variable selector here you can pipe in all kinds kinds of variables alert variables case variables things like entity identifiers even the results of a previous action this action will essentially take this file hash as an input and run it against our mandant TI database and return a result we will choose entity. identifier for consistency to run this against all the hash entities found in our malware report now we're done with a single widget enrichment let's test it our simulator by clicking on the simulator button this will then allow us to pick a test case and just simulate the whole Playbook this is why we ingested the alert as a test case if we press run it will run through all the steps and it will ensure our alert matches the Playbook criteria and also run through our only action here you can see as a result we find in the Json that this is related to the sandworm team so now we have a powerful mandant threat Intel available and we can feed it into a new action that pulls more information about that actor let's do a couple more things one we would like for the Playbook to automatically associate this threat actor and add that entity and maybe add the relationship even if we don't know exactly what action we want we can to search for entity relationship the correct action then pops in and guides us through this now we will once again pick all file hashes but this time we need to associate the actor we will go into this selector for entity identifier and just find the actor in The Json Chronicle does a great job of providing a sample Json with each action so so that you can import the correct field in your playbooks I chose this to be a threat actor and chose to link it to a file hash that has the identifier Perfect The Last Action that we're going to add is once again from ment threat Intel and that is going to give us actor information so once again we pick our widget from mandant threat intelligence and this time choose enrich entities as an action we can add this for all threat actors and all entities and this will run our enrichment and optionally create an Insight widget we can quickly test this in our simulation when we run our test we can see that our enrichment runs successfully our relationship is set and our second enrichment is able to take those enriched entities congratulations you now know how to build a simple playbook in our next video we will briefly discuss views and trying everything together to conclude our fundamentals course

[Music] video 10 managing response building views and dashboards and additional resources hello and welcome to the final video of the chronicle SEC Ops fundamentals course last time we built a simple Playbook containing two mandant threat intelligence widgets today we will display this information here we have the Playbook but we don't have a view associated with it now all that's left to do here is to create a view we can do this from the ad view button and you can choose to create a view we need to select the roles our view will be be shown to and we can then choose to add all our predefined widgets these are customizable HTML and JavaScript widgets that already come baked into our integration so we can simply drag and drop these widgets into our user experience let's add a couple more widgets the graph widget to see our new relationship to the thread actor as well as the insight's widget if you remember one of our widgets created an Insight so that would be Ed F to render with that let's click save and we have our Playbook now we can go back to the case since that case was created before this and had no Playbook let's attach this new playbook to it and see what happens we can do this by adding the plus button and navigating to the block or Playbook we want now we can see how the Playbook executes and it will refresh once it's complete then when you navigate to the overview tab you will see the new UI we built powered by the enrichments in our Playbook first you see our ioc enrichment that determined this is connected to the sandworm team then we can see information pulled from mandant TI about the sandworm team threat actor that we can expand and review our insights block contains more details and research and very nicely our graph now contains an association with the sandworm team we have now built a Playbook that automatically will give our analyst insight about malware associated with thread actors enriched with state-of-the-art intelligence to summarize we can install any of the 300 plus Integrations from the marketplace and they bring a number of out of the-box actions and widgets that can be chained together in playbooks A playbook has a great visual experience to build the logic and chain the actions together it renders a friendly experience and we did all of that without writing a single line of code in more advanced courses you will learn how to further customize this to meet any need lastly we want to discuss a few important topics as you continue your Exploration with the chronicle SEC Ops platform first it's important to note that Sor keeps track of important metrics that showcase the workload and efficiency of your sock you can explore sample dashboards in this section a dashboard holds a maximum of 12 widgets these can display data in various forms such as pie charts horizontal or vertical bars tables Roi charts etc for any specified sock environments or case occurrence time dashboards can be exported saved as a report template or shared with others this is a default dashboard visible to all users with dashboard permissions so share doesn't apply in advanc videos we will walk through how to build your own dashboards and reports but let's go through some of the sample metrics that can inspire you in that process here you can see the sock status including cases alerts and potential incidents that are being investigated analyst workloads can help our sock managers determine if certain analysts are under or over utilized at a glance additional widgets give us distributions based on alert types Source Products as well as priorities here you can see alert reduction percentage a very important metric for our sore Engineers who apply various methods to autoc closing and grouping to help reduce analysts workload at the bottom you see a number of other widgets including case handling times these dashboards can be customized to render any piece of case information relevant reports are another place where we can automate the regular reporting we do to management and customize metrics that we want to report on a regular Cadence this comes with a number of helpful built-in reports we can generate our c-level report by clicking the generate button this gives us options of whether we want this exported in PDF or word and what timeline to cover now we can just download this report and send it to our Executives who will get the metrics that have been gathered just by operating in this interface our fundamentals course is coming to an end and we've covered a lot of ground to get you the foundational understanding of the SEC Ops platform before we finish we want to mention a few other resources that you can access first make sure to bookmark the chronicle documentation under cloud.google.com Chronicle dos next in the Google Cloud Community under googlecloud community.com you can register and navigate to to the Google Cloud security Community where you will see a lot of activity content announcements and a place to collaborate with other Chronicle users we recommend following this community to stay tuned another great resource is the blog specifically the new to Chronicle blog series that provides a new user to the system with a helpful guide providing detailed instructions on how to approach Chronicle from a fresh perspective last but not least stay tuned for our next Advanced Chronicle course where we will dive deeper into more technical [Music] areas
