## Manage Bigtable on Google Cloud

### Lab - [Designing and Querying Bigtable Schemas](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/650/labs/486276)

In this lab, you explore a Bigtable instance and use the Bigtable CLI (cbt CLI) to query data in Bigtable. You also design a table schema and row key using best practices for Bigtable.
