as your organization and its data grow managing your Google Workspace becomes essential for example you might have files scattered across different drives making it difficult to locate specific information or apply consistent security measures that's where labels come in Workspace labels are metadata tags that can help categorize and manage your data think of them as virtual folders labels are more than just simple tags though as they can be customized with different colors and names making it easy to visually distinguish between data categories so how can labels help you stay organized let's explore a few examples first there is user classification labels can classify data by sensitivity level for example public internal or confidential this helps users understand how to handle and share files appropriately you can also integrate labels with data loss prevention DLP rules labels can automatically classify and protect sensitive information things like credit card numbers or personal data that way you prevent accidental leaks and ensure you're complying with data privacy regulations you can also configure default labels to automatically apply to new files based on location or type ensuring consistent classification and reducing user burden and finally Google Workspace leverages AI to automatically classify files based on their content saving time and improving accuracy especially for large volumes of data the AI classification feature is supported by the following add-ons
