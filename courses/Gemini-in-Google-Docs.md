You can use "Help me write" in Docs to help you brainstorm a captivating tagline or draft social media posts by providing a prompt like: “Generate 3 social media posts that highlight the benefits of our athletic shoes with a focus on comfort and performance.” If you work in sales, you can use Gemini to help you prepare for a meeting with a high-profile client. For example, you can ask Gemini to write 5 thoughtful questions to ask a VP of Merchandising about their strategy for the upcoming year. Or maybe you’re in human resources and want to revamp the new employee onboarding experience for financial analysts. Ask Gemini to create an onboarding checklist for the Finance team to quickly develop an important part of the new training program. If you’re in customer support, consider asking Gemini to summarize a transcript saved as a Google Docs document. Gemini can help you quickly summarize the troubleshooting steps already taken and provide a bulleted list of action items. After you type your prompt, click Create. You might need to wait a few moments for Gemini to generate a response. If you like what’s suggested, click Insert to add it to your document. If you want to improve the generated response, you can choose to refine the generated text or update the prompt you provided. You learn more about refining generated responses in the next lesson.
