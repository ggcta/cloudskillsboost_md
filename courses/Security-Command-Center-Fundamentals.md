welcome in this video we'll discuss container threat detection containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an applications code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure in today's cyber security landscape it's imperative to understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with containerization container threat detection is a critical component in identifying and addressing such risks container threat detection is a powerful security feature that is included in the security Command Center premium tier it provides continuous and comprehensive scanning of the node images of container optimized OS ensuring that any potential security threats are identified and addressed in a timely manner the service utilizes Advanced algorithms to quickly detect any runtime attacks by analyzing changes and remote access attempts in addition it provides alerts to users of common container attacks through through the security Command Center and Cloud logging the container threat detection feature is designed to detect and identify a wide range of threats including suspicious files and harmful plain text bash scripts the service employs natural language processing NLP techniques to analyze and identify potentially harmful scripts making it an extremely effective tool for securing container environments overall the container threat detection feature is an essential component of any container security strategy it provides realtime threat detection ensuring that any potential threats are addressed before they can cause damage to the system with its Advanced capabilities and comprehensive scanning container threat detection is a musthave for organizations that rely on container technology to support their business operations so how exactly does container threat detection work for starters container threat detection uses what is known as detection instrumentation this sophisticated technology collects detailed activity from the guest Colonel and any executed bash scripts when container threat detection detects an event the event information along with identifiers for the container is sent via a user mode Damon set to a specialized Detector service for in-depth analysis note that although the Damon set is designed to be diligent it operates on a best effort basis this means that if kubernetes or the container runtime is delayed in delivering container information that data might not be included in the reported findings the core of the system is the Detector service it scrutinizes the events to decide whether something is just an anomaly or a potential security incident one of the standout features of the container threat detection technology is the use of natural language processing to evaluate the contents of bash scripts determining if they're just regular scripts or something malicious if an incident is detected the service records it as a finding within the security Command Center you can check out the details of any findings directly in the security command center dashboard where you can also conduct further investigations keep in mind what you can see and do with these findings depends on the access roles you've been granted container threat detection includes a set of detectors each with specific roles and identifying potential security breaches the added binary executed detector is crucial in spotting any binary that is executed but wasn't part of the original container image such An Occurrence could indicate unauthorized access or control so it's vital for early threat detection the added Library loaded detector similar to the binary detector alerts if a library that was not in the original container image gets loaded it's another key indicator of possible unauthorized code execution within the container the malicious script executed detector employs Advanced natural language processing to analyze executed bash scripts it's designed to identify scripts that could be harmful helping catch more sophisticated attacks the malicious URL observe detector checks the argument list of running processes against a list of unsafe web resources maintained by the Google safe browsing service lastly the reverse shell detector is particularly important it identifies when a process starts with its input or output streams redirected to a remote connected socket this can be a sign of an attacker seeking to control the workload remotely a common tactic in advanced cyber attacks let's take a look at the system when you activate security Command Center premium container threat detection is enabled by default unless you choose to disable it during the activation process if you need to enable or disable container threat

### Video - [Working with Findings](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/953/video/486413)

* [YouTube: Working with Findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fcKBjGbpQ)

welcome to another session on the Google Cloud security Command Center a comprehensive platform designed for enhanced security management and risk assessment in the cloud in this session we'll focus on a critical component of this platform working with findings to ensure a robust security framework in the cloud it's critical to adopt and maintain best security practices a key feature of the security Command Center is the findings page this page is where security issues detected across your Cloud environment are recorded and presented these findings are generated by various security Command Center Services offering insights into potential security concerns each finding is a record of a specific security issue whether it's a misconfiguration a vulnerability or a Potential Threat understanding how to navigate and work with these findings is crucial for effectively managing your Cloud security throughout this video we'll explore how to query INSP ECT and mute these findings empowering you with the knowledge to proactively address and mitigate security risks in your Google Cloud environment when managing findings in the security Command Center or SEC the role of identity and access management IAM becomes even more crucial I am roles are not just about General access management they play a specific and direct role in how findings the records of potential security issues identified by SEC are handled each finding in the SEC represents a potential security issue such as a misconfiguration or a vulnerability the ability to interact with these findings whether it's to view edit or resolve them hinges specifically on the I am roles assigned to the users for example the security Command Center admin role has comprehensive privileges including full access to findings users with this role can view all findings manage their status and take remed mediation actions they can also update security policies or configurations as a response to these findings on the other hand roles like the security Command Center viewer are more limited users with this role can view findings and understand the security posture but they cannot modify the findings or take action on them the precise alignment of these I am roles is critical when dealing with findings in the SEC if a user with insufficient permissions encounters a critical finding they might not be able to act on it potentially leaving a vulnerability unaddressed conversely granting overly broad permissions could lead to unauthorized or accidental changes to findings or security settings which could compromise the cloud environment's security moreover the ability to effectively manage findings also depends on having an accurate and up-to-date understanding of each team member's role and responsibility within the organization's security framework let's demonstrate how to assign the security Center viewer role to an existing user named secc user1 1223 on the Google Cloud console dashboard select IAM and admin this action will display a comprehensive list of all members within your Google Cloud project or organization along with their respective roles to locate our sample user scroll through the list of members to find secc user1 1223 you can also utilize the filter or search functionality for a quicker search if you're working with a lengthy list of users next to secc user1 1223 click the pencil icon to edit their current role or roles in the editing interface select add another rooll in the drop- down menu search box that appears start typing security Center findings viewer when the role appears in the drop-down list select it finalize the selection by clicking the save button after saving you should now see sccc user 1223 listed with the security Center findings viewer role it's a good practice to confirm with secc user 1223 to ensure that they have access to the level you've just assigned let's explore the process of viewing specific findings we'll begin by exploring quick filters first access the findings page in security Command Center here you'll encounter the quick filters panel an intuitive tool for querying your findings these highlevel filters enable you to categorize findings based on attributes such as severity category or resource type first let's look at the state option initially a finding is set to active by the built-in detection Services indicating that the underlying security issue persists conversely a finding becomes inactive if detection Services recognize the issue has been resolved or the affected resource deleted use the show inactive option to view these findings then consider the mute feature muting a finding hides it from your default view in the Google Cloud console though you can still opt to view the muted findings following that select the specific type of finding you wish to view for example you might choose a category like unexpected compute engine region notice that queries in the query editor will automatically update to include your selection displaying only findings from that category you can also filter findings by the following classes threats which are active risks vulnerabilities the latent flaws the active risk might exploit misconfigurations which compound these risks by providing more avenues for exploitation observations which serve as alerts secc errors which indicate system level issues that could impede security monitoring and posture violations which suggest a weakening of overall security measures making the environment more susceptible to threats next you can filter findings based on the project level if the security Command Center is activated at the organization level you can filter findings by project if it's activated at the project level you'll see findings from that specific project moving on you can also filter findings by specific asset types such as a Google compute instance or a Google container cluster for more targeted control over the findings you review next the severity filter the severity of a finding ranging from critical to low indicates the urgency of remediation required while high severity findings typically demand immediate action sometimes a low severity finding might be more critical depending on various factors in addition the severity unspecified category includes findings without a set severity level finally you may filter by Source display name this filter represents services that generate findings including security health analytics event threat detection custom modules and others so with the quick filter options you can efficiently navigate and manage the findings in security Command Center initially on the findings page you'll be greeted with the default query displayed prominently in the query preview field if you're looking to customize this query simply click on the edit query button or expand the panel icon situated on the right side of the query preview section doing so will open the query editor panel a versal tool that allows for detailed query customization now you're all set to start refining your query the first step is to click on ADD filter this is
