Hello, everyone. Welcome to the course Modern Security Operations, powered by Google's Autonomic Security Operations Framework. My name is Iman Ghanizada, and I am delighted to tell you all about this course today. First off, I want to thank you. I want to thank you because I know how difficult it is to take time out of your schedules and commit to and embark on taking a course. It's going to be a multi-week learning journey. In order to better help your career, your organizations, and ultimately help benefit your families at the end of the day. You're here today, and you want to know about how Google is approaching a modern security operations approach. Well, let's go ahead and start with some of the basic foundational knowledge here. We all know that in today's day and age, it's almost become impossible to scale with all of the needs of a modern organization. If you think about it for a second, let's just reflect on the last 30 years. In the last 30 years, we have probably seen some of the most monumental impacts in the world in terms of innovation, globalization, accessibility, we fundamentally reshaped the way that our world works, and this has all been thanks to the rise of the Internet. Just in 30 short years, our worlds look completely different. Now, if you can put yourself in a position where you can imagine what the next 30 years are going to look like with AI finally being accessible, with computing, having penetrated every single industry and almost every single process and task that exists on this planet. You can imagine it's only going to get even more and more and more complex, more sophisticated. With the incredible power of AI, we're going to see some really, really, really remarkable things happening in the next several decades. This is the task that security practitioners have. The task is that we went from a world that was largely guarded by physical security guards and physical security needs and physical security devices to world where now it is dependent on the safety, the security, and the usability of all of the technology assets. From things like critical infrastructure to retail, to media and entertainment, to anything, you name it, you name the industry. It is paramount that there are security practitioners who defend and uphold the integrity of all the systems that power our world today. Now, you probably are here because you realized that with all of the computing infrastructure that's out there, with all of the devices, and the endpoints, and the servers, and the distributed environments, and clouds, and multi-clouds, and on-premise environments, and all this complexity, you name the layer of technology, it is almost become impossible to scale security across all the different facets of your environment. A lot of the tooling that we have designed to this whole security operation structure around the typical SOC model, none of this has been designed with the mindset of an exponentially growing and a more complex infrastructure environment that only gets more sophisticated as more and more engineers, more developers build products, build solutions, and continue to innovate. Keeping up with this complexity is so challenging, and we need a model that allows us to really stay nimble, stay on top of all of the needs of our organizations. Most importantly, stay ahead of our adversaries. Because quite frankly, you might be a tier 2 security operations analyst or an engineer that works on one core product of your organization. Our adversaries oftentimes don't confine to any boundaries. Their goal and their mission is oftentimes quite simple and quite straightforward, and they will do whatever it takes to execute that mission. If we need to defend our organizations, defend our institutions against adversaries who don't play by the rules, then we need to revamp and reshape the way that we approach this problem in the first place. That way, we are following a continuous development life cycle that allows us to continually protect, monitor, enhance, and build all of the necessary feedback loops we need to ensure our organizations are safe and secure. In this course, we are going to take the old security operations mindset that might have been developed over the past several decades. We're going to say thank you. We're going to say thank you for all of the foundational knowledge that has helped us get to a place where we truly understand the complexity and the needs for security practitioners. We're going to take that system, we're going to turn it upside its head. We're going to say that, you know what, if we want to be able to keep up with all of the changes that continue to happen year after year, from the types of infrastructure that's being used, to the amount of people, to where they're using systems from, to all of the different supply chain dependencies, we need a system that allows us to be more creative. We need a system that allows to be more intuitive and really be nimble with how we approach security through the entire software development life cycle. As we all know, security operations is traditionally a more reactive approach, detection and response. That basically already means that at some point, the intruder has most likely already got into your environment and we just need to figure out how to respond to that the most effectively and also how to prevent that from happening again in the future. This model is archaic. We need to figure out how we can do a better job of building a really tight feedback with the way that our applications get developed in the first place. That way, detection and response teams are not just reactive by nature. Detection and response teams are truly embedded in all of the engineering work streams that DevOps and DevSecOps, you name it, all software teams that are working upstream are continually tapped into one another. I want you to really think about the mindset shift that is going to come with this course. More than anything, if you think about it, every year, there's a new generation of juniors that get into the workforce. In order to make this an accessible workforce, an exciting workforce, a place that allows people to be creative and to thrive, we really need to break all the old systems and we need to focus on the mindset that we're using when we approach our work. We're going to go into three core areas here. We're going to cover the old Security Operations 101 just so that everyone, no matter what your role has historically been in security operations, understands the full scope of the detection and response life cycle. We're then going to shift into talking about ASO. ASO is the philosophy, the mindset of how we work. That way we all have an aligned perspective and an opinionated direction of how we're able to reduce toil so that our teams can remain most effective and what those important high-level metrics are. Then lastly, we're going to talk about continuous detection, continuous response, which is the methodology that we've defined as a way so that we can build engineering workflows, using any type of tooling you may already be using today, but shifting into following this engineering-like mindset, that way our teams can truly be ahead and on top of all of the needs of their businesses. I want you to go grab some coffee, grab a water, buckle up. We're going to have fun right ahead, and don't forget to take breaks, don't forget to have a good time. If there's anything really interesting to you, feel free to reach out. Find someone who's working in the space, talk to your community, talk to your peers. Find us on LinkedIn. We're here to help along the way. Catch you at Week 1. Take care.

Welcome to module one of the Autonomic Security Operations course, where we’ll discuss the issues that plague traditional security operations teams and unravel each one of them. This novel new approach to modernizing your threat management function will force you to think beyond the confines of your roles and truly consider all aspects of the security development lifecycle as you engineer solutions to operational challenges. Our focus is on understanding the future of cybersecurity, technology challenges, people and process challenges, and the rise of autonomic security. Our first objective is to understand the constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity and what impact it has on security operations. Secondly, we identify and address technology challenges in security operations to stay ahead of emerging threats. Next, we uncover people and process challenges in security operations and explore strategies for improvement. Lastly, we discuss the rise of autonomic security and its potential to transform your threat management processes. Through our exploration of these objectives, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced in security operations and be able to lay the groundwork for potential solutions offered by autonomic security. Get ready for an enlightening and transformative week ahead! Dr. Anton Chuvakin once said, "You cannot ops your way out of a dev problem, but you can certainly dev your way out of an ops problem…" To elaborate, this powerful quote highlights a fundamental truth in the realm of security operations. It emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of problems rather than solely relying on operational fixes. Let’s unpack this quote and explore its meaning in the context of our work. Let’s break down the key phrases. "You cannot ops your way out of a dev problem" reminds us that operational efforts alone cannot resolve issues originating from flawed development or system design. No matter how efficient or effective our security operations may be, they cannot compensate for inadequacies in the underlying architecture, coding practices, or system configurations. Conversely, "you can certainly dev your way out of an ops problem" suggests that by investing in development practices and technologies, we can alleviate operational challenges. This approach allows us to tackle issues proactively, automate repetitive tasks, and build resilient systems that are easier to operate and secure. So what is the relevance to Autonomic Security? This quote aligns closely with the principles of autonomic security operations, emphasizing the need for collaboration between development and operations teams. By adopting a holistic approach and integrating security into the development lifecycle, we can effectively address operational challenges and build secure, resilient systems from the ground up. In closing, Dr. Anton Chuvakin’s quote serves as a reminder that a comprehensive approach is crucial in overcoming security operations challenges. By understanding the interplay between development and operations, we can leverage the power of both disciplines to enhance our security posture. Keep this wisdom in mind as we embark on our journey towards autonomic security operations.

Let’s explore four key topics that are integral to the understanding of modernizing security operations. The first topic we discuss focuses on the future of cybersecurity; where our world has gone in such a short span of time, and where we’re headed in an even shorter span of time. Witness the remarkable chart of population growth over the last 12,000 years, which provides valuable insights into the rapid evolution of our civilization. But what is the relevance to the cybersecurity landscape? Let’s link population growth to cybersecurity. In just the past few centuries, our population has experienced exponential growth, coinciding with the rapid advancement of technology. The last few decades, in particular, have seen the emergence of the internet and its profound impact on our lives. To shed some perspective on technological progress, the internet has transformed the way we communicate, conduct business, and interact with the world. With this rapid technological progress, however, comes a significant challenge – cybersecurity. So what are the implications for cybersecurity? The interconnectedness of our digitally-dependent world brings both immense opportunities and vulnerabilities. As our population grows, so does the potential attack surface for cyber threats. Protecting sensitive data, securing critical infrastructure, and safeguarding individuals and businesses from cyber risks become paramount. What are our responsibility and ethical considerations? In this era of technological transformation, it is our collective responsibility to prioritize cybersecurity. We must ensure the responsible use of technology, protect against cyber threats, and address ethical considerations such as privacy, data protection, and equitable access to digital resources. This population growth chart serves as a reminder of the rapid changes our world has undergone. As our civilization continues to evolve, we must remain vigilant in protecting ourselves from cyber threats, leveraging technology to enhance security, and fostering a safe digital environment for all. Now, if you’re tenured in your career, consider how much change has happened over the past 10 years… imagine what the next 10 will look like? We all need to be aligned in our mission to protect our digital world and how we’re structurally going about it. Securing our digital future is paramount. The world has evolved so fast. Let’s examine seven exciting developments and their security implications. The first emerging technological trend is usable artificial intelligence. Usable artificial intelligence, adopted by developers, businesses, and adversaries, will become one of the most powerful capabilities ever produced, with the potential for solving the greatest problems in the world. However, in the wrong hands, it can be equally as impactful. It becomes crucial to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of AI systems, mitigating the risks of potential misuse, algorithmic bias, and ensuring the guardrails exist to protect our world. Safeguarding AI systems from malicious exploitation is of utmost importance in this era of unprecedented technological potential. The second emerging technological trend is drones and autonomous vehicles. Drones and autonomous vehicles are rapidly advancing, revolutionizing industries, and bringing transformative possibilities. However, connected access in the wrong hands can be devastating. The third emerging technological trend is migration to hybrid and mixed reality. The migration from physical reality to hybrid and mixed reality (AR/VR/MR) brings new dimensions to security operations. Securing the immersive digital experiences and protecting the privacy and integrity of user data become paramount in this interconnected virtual realm. Forty years ago nobody imagined we’d spend half of our days on a rectangle screen, and we can predict that laptops will be a thing of the past when augmented reality capabilities are portable and viable for more use cases. The fourth emerging technological trend is digital-connected global supply chains. Global supply chains have become highly dependent on digital-connected everything, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. Securing the digital supply chain, implementing robust access controls, and ensuring data integrity throughout the supply chain are crucial for maintaining a resilient and secure ecosystem. The fifth emerging technological trend is robotics and automation. The increasing use of robotics and automation presents both opportunities and challenges for security operations. Securing these interconnected systems, protecting against potential tampering or misuse, and addressing ethical considerations surrounding autonomous decision-making are key focus areas. The sixth emerging technological trend is bio-engineering and human connectivity. The expanding use cases of bio-engineering and human connectivity technologies introduce unique security challenges. Safeguarding personal data, ensuring the privacy and consent of individuals, and addressing potential risks of unauthorized access or misuse are key considerations in this rapidly evolving landscape. The seventh and last emerging technological trend is deep interconnectivity. The deep interconnectivity of humans and inter-planetary connectivity as we pioneer space expands the attack surface for potential cyber threats. Safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of communications, as well as ensuring the resilience of interconnected systems, becomes vital in this interconnected world where algorithms that produce deepfakes and artificial content can be mistaken for authentic content. In closing, these emerging technological trends not only bring transformative opportunities but also pose significant security challenges and opportunities for professionals like you to solve! Let’s take a glimpse into the future of cybersecurity with four predictions from Google Cloud. These insights shed light on the direction in which the cybersecurity landscape is heading. The first prediction is automation in security operations. This prediction suggests that 90% of security operations workflows will be automated and managed as code, with a 90/10 split. However, the last 10% of workflow challenges will be the most complex that require all of the time and resourcing. This shift towards automation holds the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations. The second prediction is cybersecurity talent shortage. According to the predictions, the cybersecurity talent shortage, currently estimated at over 700,000 jobs, is expected to persist and potentially increase. This shortage highlights the ongoing challenge organizations face in acquiring and retaining skilled cybersecurity professionals. The third prediction is automation of cybersecurity with AI and ML. AI and ML are used to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of a cyber threat. This allows for detection and response to cyber threats more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. The fourth and last prediction is data actionability with ML. An actionable insight is derived from raw data analysis, that can be turned directly into an action or a response. These days, analytics platforms rely on AI and ML that feeds raw data to algorithms to identify patterns and predict future outcomes. These four predictions provide valuable insights into the future trajectory of cybersecurity. As we move forward, embracing automation, addressing the talent shortage, leveraging AI and ML for decision-making, and harnessing real-time actionable insights will be critical for organizations to stay ahead in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.

The future is both exciting and daunting. We’re here to welcome it with open arms, but in order to do that, we need to understand the people, process, and technology challenges that plague our approach today. Let’s explore the technology challenges first. Computing environments have evolved so much, so fast. Let’s discuss some of those points. Digital transformation initiatives expand an organization’s attack surface, introducing new entry points for potential cyber threats. Robust security measures are necessary to mitigate risks effectively in this evolving landscape. Modern computing environments undergo constant technological evolution, from the era of mainframes to virtual machines, and now to technologies such as Kubernetes and serverless computing. This evolution introduces new paradigms and architectures, challenging security practices to adapt and ensure effective protection against emerging threats. The cybersecurity landscape expands beyond traditional Security Operations Centers (SOCs), encompassing cloud services, IoT devices, and third-party integrations. Comprehensive security strategies are required to protect organizations from diverse attack vectors. Network-centric security models are giving way to identity-centric access models. With the rise of cloud services, mobile devices, and remote work, organizations prioritize access controls and authentication, enhancing security measures. With the technological complexities evolving, we have the challenge of an exponential increase in alert signals, which poses significant difficulties for security operations. Let’s explore the key points associated with this pressing issue. The sheer volume of alerts can overwhelm security operations (SecOps) teams, leading to alert fatigue. This condition can desensitize team members to alerts, potentially resulting in missed or delayed responses to genuine threats. While automation can help filter out low-level alerts and alleviate the burden on SecOps teams, many systems lack the sophistication to effectively handle the volume and complexity of alerts generated by modern security systems. The rising number of false positive alerts in proportion to genuine alerts creates a higher signal-to-noise ratio. This makes it more challenging for SecOps teams to identify real threats and respond effectively, potentially leading to increased response times and heightened risks. The constant barrage of alerts places significant stress on SecOps team members, increasing the risk of burnout and staff turnover. This, in turn, contributes to a shortage of skilled personnel, compounding the challenges posed by the exponential increase in alert signals. The volume of alerts consumes substantial resources from SecOps team members, including time and energy. This drain can result in burnout, reducing the team’s overall effectiveness and ability to perform their critical roles. In closing, the exponential increase in alert signals presents significant challenges for security operations. Addressing these challenges requires finding ways to combat alert fatigue, improve automation capabilities, manage the risk of burnout, reduce the noise-to-signal ratio, and effectively allocate resources. By addressing these issues, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to genuine threats in an increasingly complex threat landscape. Legacy security products and tools are struggling to keep pace with the ever-evolving landscape of hacker techniques. Let’s examine some of the key reasons why hackers are outperforming these legacy solutions. The over-proliferation of legacy security tools can create complexity and inefficiency, making it challenging to streamline security operations and manage the diverse toolset effectively. Legacy tools may suffer from significant visibility gaps, leaving blind spots that prevent comprehensive coverage across diverse digital environments. Legacy security products often lack robust artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced engineering capabilities, hindering their ability to effectively detect and respond to sophisticated threats. Legacy technologies are not designed to operate at cloud-scale, limiting their scalability and performance in modern cloud-based environments.

Technology is both one of the most exciting things for practitioners when it works well, but also one of the most frustrating parts when it doesn’t. Great tools require even better people and process to harness the power of them. Let’s discuss some people and process challenges. Cybersecurity is a challenging profession, requiring diverse skills across domains such as technology, collaboration, and business. Professionals must possess technical expertise in areas such as networking, operating systems, and security technologies to protect organizations effectively. Collaboration skills are crucial, as they work with various stakeholders, including IT teams, management, and external partners, to align security practices and foster a strong security culture. A business mindset is essential to understand organizational goals, risk appetite, and regulatory requirements, ensuring security measures support business objectives without hindering productivity. Continuous learning and adaptability are vital due to the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, requiring professionals to stay updated on emerging threats, technologies, and regulations. This presents a challenge to set aside training time, while fully occupied with resolving alerts. Stress on the job is often carried over to the analyst’s home life, which tends to negatively impact their overall psychological state. And this then carries back over to the workplace. When a security incident occurs, the security analysts are in the war room 24/7 dealing with the issues and executing their incident response processes to help resume the business to normal. They absorb all of the stress during an incident and it almost always impacts their personal lives. Many analysts face a burnout after two years on the job, leaving SecOps teams with a high employee turnover and a shortage of on the job experience. The shortage of skilled labor in cybersecurity poses challenges due to the multifaceted skillset needed. Addressing this shortage requires fostering talent development programs, promoting collaboration, and raising awareness of rewarding career opportunities in cybersecurity. The current threat management process faces challenges in optimizing for the future. Let’s explore the key points that illustrate these challenges. Limited influence across the organization hampers alignment and collaboration between cybersecurity teams and other business units. A significant gap exists between senior security engineers and security analysts, leading to inefficiencies in threat management. The threat management process is heavily siloed, hindering collaboration and information sharing across roles, functions, and organizations. Analysts organized into tiers create bottlenecks, slower response times, and limitations in handling complex and evolving threats. Inefficient processes in security operations create various challenges that need to be addressed. Manual handling of alerts and a lack of automation overburden the alert triage process. This can result in response delays and increase the risk of critical threats being missed. Inefficient processes often lack a feedback loop to optimize and improve the end-to-end workflow. Without capturing feedback and implementing enhancements, organizations struggle to streamline their security operations. Limited collaboration across the workflow leads to lengthy resolution durations. Siloed teams and inadequate communication hinder efficient incident response and resolution. To optimize security operations, it is crucial to address inefficient processes. Organizations should focus on automation to streamline alert triage, establish a feedback loop for continuous workflow improvement, and foster collaboration to reduce resolution times. These improvements will enhance overall operational efficiency and effectiveness.

We’ve spent a lot of time discussing many of the challenges across cybersecurity and the security operations practice. It’s important to consider the past, present, and future when determining how to approach problem solving for tomorrow’s adversaries. In our next topic, we give a sneak peek into the rise of ASO and how this approach presents a solution for adapting to these challenges. Autonomic Security Operations is defined as a framework of practices and principles that promote continuous improvement of an organization’s ability to withstand modern security attacks through an adaptive, agile, and highly automated approach to threat management. Collaboration is needed across the industry, from competitors, practitioners, CISOs and leaders alike to consider how we build this future together. This sounds a lot like what DevOps did to software development. Today’s security operations teams face numerous strategic issues that must be factored into their programs. To ensure effectiveness and maximize their impact, security operations must address five key areas: efficiency, efficacy, continuous improvement, modernization, and optimization. These strategic issues are critical in driving a successful security operations program and mitigating business risks in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Increasing efficiency is vital for security operations teams. By automating repetitive tasks and optimizing workflows, teams are empowered to focus on addressing true business risks. Streamlining processes and leveraging technology not only enhances productivity but also enables security professionals to allocate their valuable time and expertise where it matters most. Security practitioners must proactively defend organizations against all business threats. Evaluating efficacy means assessing how effectively threats are detected and responded to, and if security incidents are mitigated. It involves staying ahead of emerging threats, leveraging threat intelligence, and continually enhancing defensive capabilities to ensure the highest level of protection for our organization’s assets. Driving continuous improvement is essential for security operations. Every security incident presents an opportunity to learn, adapt, and strengthen our defenses. By analyzing past incidents, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing lessons learned, we can enhance our incident response capabilities, refine security processes, and foster a culture of continuous growth and resilience. The most important part of continuous improvement is establishing a critical feedback loop with the business and development teams, as security operations teams are not typically responsible for the management of infrastructure. To effectively combat tomorrow’s adversaries, security operations must embrace modernization. This includes adopting advanced tools, leveraging emerging technologies, and aligning with industry best practices. By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, enhancing the skills and expertise of our teams, and adapting our processes to match the evolving threat landscape, we can build a resilient security program that remains prepared for the challenges of the future. Ensuring fiscal sustainability and maximizing return on investment (ROI) is crucial for any security operations program. It involves assessing the costs associated with security technologies, personnel, and operational processes against the value they provide. By optimizing resource allocation, measuring performance, and demonstrating the tangible benefits of security initiatives, we can justify investments and secure the necessary resources to maintain an effective security posture. Set these five questions at the top of your priorities and you’ll have the end goal in mind. As we explore the concept of Autonomic Security Operations, it’s valuable to examine Google’s transformation journey. In 2015, the lack of automation was leading to a significant amount of toil as the Alphabet estate was growing significantly and causing scalability issues for the security team. Let’s delve into the key highlights of Google’s journey. Transformation Effort: In 2015, Google’s automation capabilities were minimal, and the unit cost of managing detection and response (D&R) events was high. However, driven by a radical focus on the adoption of SRE-based approaches, Google initiated a major transformation effort. Over the course of several years, their security team witnessed exponential growth in Alphabet’s estate, but through a focused program, they achieved a remarkable 90% level of efficiency. Enabling Engineers for Higher-Order Work: As Google progressed in their transformation journey, automation became the cornerstone that allowed their engineers to shift their focus from low-value, toil-based work to more creative, complex, and proactive activities. Freed from manual tasks, engineers could engage in more proactive threat hunting, perform in-depth investigations, and operating like full-stack security engineers focused on building sophisticated capabilities for detection use cases and collaborating across Alphabet to ensure their risks are mitigated. The result was a significant improvement in their ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats. Harnessing Threat Intelligence: Another critical aspect of their journey was the better consumption, creation, and operationalization of threat intelligence across detection workflows. Google’s sophisticated Threat Analysis Group (TAG) is on the cutting edge of adversarial intelligence, and to make this threat research operational, there is a strong interlock between this team and the security engineering function. By integrating threat intelligence into their processes and tools, they were able to enhance their detection capabilities, proactively identify emerging threats, and respond more effectively to potential security incidents. This integration also allowed security engineers to collaborate closely with upstream development teams, enabling the mitigation of entire classes of threats before they even reached the detection and response workflow. This transformation journey is a testament to the power of automation, SRE-based approaches, and a relentless focus on optimization. By prioritizing automation and enabling engineers to engage in higher-order work, Google has been able to elevate security operations to a new level and prioritize the most advanced threats for the business. The DevOps deployment framework Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) had some relevance but was not entirely related to the security operations lifecycle. So, Google created a framework to bridge the gap called Continuous Detection, Continuous Response (CD/CR). This is the crux of ASO and how to make this operational. Behind this CD/CR framework, Google designed layers of content to showcase. How to map people to more modern, skill based agile teams versus their legacy tiered SecOps structure How to take those people and map them to the CD/CR process structure Common dashboards to track and measure across CD/CR How to map capabilities across Google, Mandiant, and third-party products to your CD/CR development pipeline And how you can drive continuous measurement and improvement of those five strategic objectives The idea is to shift your team to operate more like a software team, rather than an operational team. Remember Dr. Chuvakin’s quote? But how can we simplify your transition to this CD/CR model? To make things easy, Google created an ASO Discovery tool where you can answer approximately 20 questions to benchmark where you are ranked against the ASO Maturity model. The tool also provides recommendations on best practices, products and services, and content that Google created or exists publicly to help you get to the next level of maturity on a single question. In a public case study, Wealthsimple, a company focused on financial services, shared their experience with implementing Autonomic Security Operations. Through self-assessment exercises and a transformation across the four pillars of ASO, they have achieved remarkable results in enhancing their security operations. Wealthsimple conducted self-assessment exercises to evaluate the past, present, and future state of their SecOps, focusing on the four pillars of Autonomic Security Operations: People Transformation, Process Transformation, Technology Transformation, and Influence Transformation. This comprehensive approach enabled them to better protect their clients and their data by improving their detection mechanisms and minimizing incident response time. By shifting their focus to innovating Security Operations, Wealthsimple has achieved significant outcomes. They successfully reduced high severity incidents by 50% and experienced lower severity of threats thanks to the development of comprehensive playbooks. Furthermore, their efforts in streamlining security operations allowed for the consolidation of security alerts, leading to better efficiency and a more targeted response to potential threats. In addition to incident management, Wealthsimple launched a comprehensive Brand Protection program as part of their ASO initiative. This program helps mitigate digital risks, safeguard their brand reputation, and further protect their clients and their sensitive data. The positive impact of adopting Autonomic Security Operations extends beyond operational improvements. Wealthsimple has seen an increase in team satisfaction as they have reduced toil and repetitive tasks. This has created more space for their security team to engage in interesting and innovative work that is proactive rather than reactive. The case study from Wealthsimple demonstrates the tangible benefits that come with embracing Autonomic Security Operations. Their achievements in improved incident management, consolidated security alerts, and the launch of a comprehensive Brand Protection program highlight the power of a comprehensive ASO approach. By focusing on people, processes, technology, and influence, organizations can drive significant improvements in security outcomes, team dynamics, and their ability to proactively protect their organization and clients. Like Site Reliability Engineering, we’re now starting to see ASO-related jobs appear in the market. The movement towards ASO has begun, will you be a part of it? Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are essential for the security industry due to the following three reasons. Broadened Perspectives and Innovative Solutions: Embracing DEI in the security industry leads to a broader range of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds within the workforce. This diversity of thought enhances problem-solving capabilities and promotes the development of innovative solutions. When security teams consist of individuals from different cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds, they can better understand and anticipate the diverse needs and vulnerabilities of the communities they serve. This enables more effective and inclusive security strategies, ensuring the safety and well-being of all individuals. Enhanced Trust and Community Engagement: Building trust between security providers and the communities they serve is crucial for the effectiveness of security efforts. DEI plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining that trust. When security teams reflect the diversity of the community, they foster a sense of belonging, representation, and inclusion. This promotes positive community relations and increases public confidence in security measures. This also allows hiring managers to tap into a much larger talent pool, especially in an industry that is struggling with resources. By actively involving diverse voices in decision-making processes and engaging with marginalized communities, the security industry can develop strategies that are respectful, culturally sensitive, and responsive to community needs, thereby enhancing overall security outcomes. Improved Decision-Making and Risk Mitigation: The security industry deals with complex and ever-evolving threats, where effective decision-making and risk mitigation are paramount. Research consistently shows that diverse teams make better decisions. By incorporating individuals from various backgrounds, the security industry can tap into a wider range of expertise, experiences, and insights. This diversity fosters critical thinking, creativity, and a more comprehensive understanding of potential risks. It also helps to identify and address blind spots that may arise from homogeneous perspectives, reducing the likelihood of overlooking important security considerations. In summary, DEI is vital for the security industry as it brings together diverse perspectives, improves decision-making, mitigates risks more effectively, and fosters trust and engagement within communities. By prioritizing DEI, the security industry can work towards creating a safer and more inclusive environment for all individuals.

To recap, the world which we’re headed towards requires you to safeguard it. Cybersecurity practitioners, in essence, are becoming protectors of our free world. And it is up to us to develop their capabilities. In order to protect our future, we need a radical shift towards automation to free up time and solve for the complex ‘needle-in-the-haystack’ challenges. At the same time, we also need to create space for a future that continues to make this an attractive profession. To this end, leverage ASO and the CD/CR framework to guide you on this path towards modernization. We have now completed module one, which largely focused on the background of why this approach was created. In our next module, we want to make sure that everyone understands the core components of SecOps. Some people may have spent an entire career as an incident responder, some as an analyst, some as a detection engineer, and others who may have never worked in security operations before. What’s critical is that we all understand everyone else’s jobs so that we can architect processes that help us truly integrate both across the security program and across the business. Looking forward to seeing you in the next module!

Welcome to Module 2: SecOps 101. In this module, we provide you with a comprehensive overview of security operations, covering the essential concepts, processes, and tools involved. Whether you’re new to security operations or seeking a refresher, this module will equip you with a solid foundation in the field. First, we revisit and align on the core mission of security operations. Next, we discuss all of the fundamental concepts and components across the practice. Then, we review tooling. And lastly, we discuss why and share a glimpse of how we’re going to defeat the old ideas of a SOC. Let’s get started. In the words of Phil Venables, CISO at Google Cloud, “Security operations in an increasingly digital world, facing ever more sophisticated adversaries, requires a 10X increase in capabilities.” This quote highlights the critical need for security operations teams to enhance their capabilities to effectively defend against evolving threats. The concept of Autonomic Security Operations, which combines advanced technologies, automation, and ongoing transformation, not only empowers organizations to achieve improved protection but also ensures they stay ahead of the ever-changing threat landscape. By embracing Autonomic Security Operations, security teams can build a resilient and adaptive defense posture that is essential in today’s digital landscape.

### Video - [What Does SecOps Do](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504216)

- [YouTube: What Does SecOps Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4ZlKPK1w8)

In our first topic, we discuss the mission of security operations. First, what is SecOps? Security operations, or SecOps, is made up of people and technologies that work 24/7 to identify, isolate, and react to cyber threats. It is a mix of expertise, including security experts, engineers, incident responders, forensic analysts, and more, such as software developers. The mission of SecOps is to safeguard organizations against cyber threats, ensure compliance with regulations, and minimize overall risk. Let’s explore the key points that define this mission. The first part of the mission is detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. Security operations teams work diligently to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats promptly. They employ various techniques, tools, and processes to identify and mitigate security incidents, minimizing potential damage to the organization. The second part of the mission is proactively manage cybersecurity risks. SecOps takes a proactive approach to manage cybersecurity risks. By continuously monitoring the environment, conducting risk assessments, and implementing preventive measures, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and potential threats, enabling them to take timely actions to mitigate risks. The third part of the mission is ensure compliance with regulations and standards. Compliance with regulations and industry standards is a critical aspect of security operations. SecOps teams work to establish and maintain adherence to relevant regulations and standards, ensuring that the organization meets legal requirements and industry best practices. The overall mission of security operations is to protect organizations against cyber threats, proactively manage risks, and ensure compliance with regulations and standards. By diligently detecting and responding to threats, taking a proactive risk management approach, and maintaining compliance, security operations teams play a vital role in minimizing risk and protecting the organization’s digital assets. If security operations were organized by high-level themes, they’d be categorized as architecture and engineering, monitoring and operations, and metrics and reporting. Architecture and engineering forms the foundation of security operations. It involves activities such as the design and implementation of tooling and infrastructure, log collection and ingestion, enrichment, automation, and use case engineering. This component focuses on building a solid infrastructure that enables efficient handling of security events and incidents. The next component is monitoring/analysis. Here, security operations teams engage in ongoing alert triage, monitoring, investigation, incident response, and threat hunting. This component is responsible for responding to alerts and mitigating threats effectively The third component is metrics/reporting. Security operations teams must have a system in place to track and measure their performance, as well as communicate relevant security information to stakeholders. This involves management and ticketing systems for incident tracking, generating comprehensive reports on security operations activities, creating informative dashboards for visualization, and providing education and awareness to stakeholders about security metrics and trends. These key components work together synergistically to establish a strong and comprehensive security operations framework. By focusing on architecture/engineering, monitoring/analysis, and metrics/reporting, security operations teams can enhance their ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats effectively, ensuring the protection of critical assets and maintaining a proactive security posture.

- [YouTube: Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR8pCf1oHVo)

Now let’s examine the specific SecOps functions so you understand the workflow from ingest to incident response. The first key function of security operations is collection. This function focuses on gathering the necessary data for security monitoring and analysis. Let’s explore the key points that define this function. First, a few words of wisdom – without logs, there is no data for you to detect a potential threat. Imagine if security guards at banks looked at blank screens all day. Logs form the basis of observability data that a detection engineer needs to be able to identify malicious patterns and create rules to alert on. The collection function involves the following steps. Step 1 is to identify data sources and information needs. Security operations teams identify the relevant data sources and determine what information needs to be collected to support security monitoring and analysis. This includes considering network logs, system logs, application logs, cloud logs, and other relevant sources. Step 2 is to configure logging and data sources. Once the data sources are identified, security teams configure the logging mechanisms and other data sources to ensure that they capture the required information accurately and consistently. Step 3 is to ingest and normalize data. Processes are developed to ingest and normalize data from various sources into a centralized repository or data lake. This consolidation enables efficient analysis and correlation of security events. Step 4 is to implement data quality checks and validation. To maintain the integrity of collected data, security operations implement data quality checks and validation processes. These measures help ensure that the collected data is accurate, complete, and consistent. Step 5 is to implement data retention policies. Security operations teams establish data retention policies to define the appropriate duration for storing collected data. These policies align with compliance and legal requirements and help maintain data availability for future investigations and analysis. An important point to remember is to prioritize your crown jewel assets. As part of the collection function, it is crucial to identify and prioritize your crown jewel assets—critical systems, sensitive data, or key intellectual property. Collecting data from these high-value assets ensures that they receive heightened security attention and protection. The collection function is a crucial component that forms the basis of security operations. By effectively identifying data sources, configuring logging mechanisms, ingesting and normalizing data, implementing data quality checks, and adhering to data retention policies, organizations can lay the foundation for comprehensive security monitoring and analysis.

### Video - [Detection](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504218)

- [YouTube: Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r93UE4fbTsg)

The next key function of security operations is detection. This function focuses on identifying patterns of suspicious activity and detecting potential security incidents. Let’s explore the key points that define this function. Identifying the needle in the haystack actually isn’t as simple as writing a basic rule in your SIEM and calling it a day. The detection process requires employing multiple approaches to identify the needle in the haystack of security events. It involves combining automated correlation, threat intelligence, and human expertise to uncover hidden threats and potential security incidents. The detection function involves the following activities. One activity is for Security Operations teams to leverage SIEM tools to correlate and analyze security events, identifying patterns of suspicious activity. SIEM tools provide a centralized platform for monitoring and detecting potential threats. There are other implementations of this capability through security data lakes and other means, but at the end of the day, the key functionality a team needs is to be able to aggregate data, identify patterns, and create high quality rules to provide meaningful alerts for your analysts to triage and respond to. A second activity is to utilize threat intelligence feeds. Threat intelligence feeds are utilized to enrich data and proactively identify indicators of compromise (IOCs). These feeds provide valuable insights into emerging threats and known malicious activities. Think of threat intelligence as a form of data that tells you the exact tactics, techniques, and procedures (or TTPs) that your adversary is using, so that you can create rules to alert on those patterns if they were to occur in your environment. High quality threat intelligence allows organizations to get as close to the adversary as possible. A third activity is to create detection rules. Security operations teams create detection rules to proactively alert on patterns of suspicious activity. These rules help identify potential threats in real-time, enabling your analysts to triage and respond to threats as they occur. A fourth activity is to hunt for undetected adversaries. In addition to proactive detection, security operations teams employ retroactive querying techniques to hunt for undetected adversaries. By querying relevant data across the organization, they can uncover hidden threats and investigate past incidents. There’s a common statistic that it takes the average organization 180 days to identify an adversary… imagine if someone was moving freely and undetected in your organization for 6 months! An important point is that higher data collection rates and better data quality significantly enhance detection capabilities. By collecting more data and ensuring its accuracy and completeness, security operations improve their ability to detect and respond to potential threats. The detection function is a critical aspect of security operations. By using SIEM tools for correlation and analysis, utilizing threat intelligence feeds, creating detection rules, and employing proactive and retrospective hunting techniques, organizations can enhance their ability to identify and respond to security incidents effectively.

### Video - [Triage](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504219)

- [YouTube: Triage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmVO9BliD3U)

The next key function of security operations is triage. This function involves reviewing, prioritizing, and conducting initial investigations on security alerts to identify actual threats. Triage helps analysts prioritize the most critical alerts. Triage is crucial for security analysts to prioritize the most critical alerts, ensuring that the organization focuses its resources on the most significant threats. Let’s explore the key points that define this function. The first is for security analysts to review and prioritize security alerts based on factors such as severity, impact, and other contextual information. This prioritization ensures that the most critical alerts receive immediate attention. The second point is to conduct initial investigations. Analysts perform initial investigations on the identified alerts to determine if they represent actual threats. This involves gathering additional information, analyzing indicators of compromise (IOCs), and assessing the potential impact. The third point is to disregard false positives or low priority alerts. To optimize efficiency, analysts disregard false positives or low priority alerts that do not pose a significant threat. This helps focus their efforts on genuine security incidents. The fourth point is to enrich cases with additional data. Analysts enrich the investigation cases with additional data, such as threat intelligence, historical logs, and relevant context. This data enrichment reduces toil for subsequent investigators and facilitates comprehensive analysis. The fifth point is to escalate to senior investigators or incident response team. If needed, analysts escalate the investigation to more senior investigators or the incident response team. This ensures appropriate expertise and resources are dedicated to complex or confirmed threats. The last part of the alert triage is to escalate confirmed threats to the incident response team, that way they can take timely action and eradicate the threat. If an analyst is able to catch and confirm a threat as early as the initial triage, it allows incident response teams to react quickly. The main takeaway is that by leveraging automated alert triage and simplified workflows, security operations drive greater efficiency in the triage process. These measures reduce manual effort, streamline operations, and enable analysts to handle a higher volume of alerts. The triage function plays a vital role in security operations. By reviewing, prioritizing, and conducting initial investigations, analysts can identify and respond to actual threats efficiently. Through automation and simplified workflows, organizations enhance their alert triage capabilities and improve overall operational efficiency.

- [YouTube: Investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrpqEx_g7Zk)

The next key function of security operations is investigation. This function involves a deeper analysis of alerts by more senior analysts (oftentimes referred to as Tier 2) using various tools and techniques. Let’s explore the key points that define this function. Investigation verifies whether the alert is a true or false positive. This verification is crucial to ensure accurate response and mitigation efforts. The investigation function involves the following steps. Step 1 is deeper analysis by Tier 2 analysts. Tier 2 analysts conduct a more thorough investigation of alerts to determine if they represent genuine security threats. This involves employing advanced tools and techniques to analyze the available data and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Step 2 is to verify and gather information. The Tier 2 analyst goal is to verify whether the alert is a true or false positive and then gather additional information if needed. In step 3, analysts dig deeper, pivot to other data sources, collaborate with other teams, and document their findings and recommendations. Investigations and underlying security data can be so complex and multifaceted, spanning across the world and across hundreds or thousands of systems. Ensuring that these teams are equipped with the ability to conduct a thorough analysis and document findings is crucial to finding the needle in the haystack. Step 4 determines the duration, which varies based on factors. The duration of the investigation stage can vary depending on factors such as limited visibility and context, complexity of the incident, resource constraints, data/system accessibility, collaboration, documentation, and knowledge sharing. It is important to address false positives for proactive threat management. Many security teams operate with a high ratio of false positives, impairing their ability to be proactive against complex threats. Effective investigation techniques, improved data quality, and advanced analytics can help reduce false positives and enable proactive threat management. The investigation function is a critical aspect of security operations. By conducting deeper analysis, verifying alerts, gathering additional information, and addressing false positives, analysts play a crucial role in identifying genuine security threats and enabling proactive response measures. Collaboration, documentation, and knowledge sharing are key to ensure effective investigations and enhance the overall security posture.

- [YouTube: Incident Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OixWJhgNlZ8)

The final key function of security operations is incident response. This function involves containing, eradicating, and recovering from a security incident. Let’s explore the key points that define this function. The ultimate goal of incident response is to minimize the impact of a security incident and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. A swift and effective response can make a significant difference in preventing adverse consequences for the organization. The incident response function involves the following steps. Step 1 is to contain, eradicate, and recover. Incident response teams work to contain the impact of a security incident, eradicate the threat, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. This includes identifying the root cause, implementing necessary controls, and remediation actions. Step 2 is to minimize impact and restore operations. The primary goal of incident response is to minimize the impact of the incident on the organization and restore normal operations promptly. Rapid response and effective mitigation efforts are critical during this stage. Step 3 is to involve various teams and stakeholders. Incident response may involve collaboration with various teams and stakeholders, including IT, legal, HR, and external partners. Their expertise and contributions help ensure a comprehensive and coordinated response. Step 4 is to communicate and coordinate. Effective communication and coordination are crucial during incident response. Clear communication channels, incident response plans, and playbooks help guide the process and ensure all stakeholders are aligned. And lastly, conduct a post-incident review. After resolving the incident, it is important to conduct a post-incident review. This review allows the organization to identify lessons learned, assess the effectiveness of incident response actions, and make improvements to the incident response process. Remember that effective incident response can be the X-factor in determining whether an organization ends up on the front-page news due to a security incident or effectively mitigates and manages the incident with minimal impact. The incident response function is a critical aspect of security operations. By containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents, organizations can minimize the impact and restore normal operations promptly. Collaboration, communication, and post-incident reviews are essential to ensure an effective incident response and continuous improvement of the overall security posture. In addition to the core functions of SecOps, there are various adjacent teams, capabilities, and services that play a vital role in supporting and enhancing security operations. Let’s explore these adjacent areas that assist SecOps in proactive detection and response, upstream influence, and continuous improvement. The following adjacent teams, capabilities, and services help SecOps perform at their best. For Proactive Detection and Response, the following is performed. Threat Intelligence: Collecting, analyzing, and sharing information on emerging threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Threat Hunting: Proactively searching for signs of advanced threats or malicious activities that may have evaded traditional security measures. Red Teaming/Pen Testing: Simulating well-defined threats to assess the security posture and identify vulnerabilities.

- [YouTube: Defeating the Idea of a SOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn9kxk8_wDs)

Lastly, let’s discuss why we need to defeat the idea of a SOC. The field of security operations is at a critical juncture, with organizations facing numerous challenges that hinder their ability to effectively detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats. Let's explore some key points shared by clients in the field, highlighting the pressing need for transformation in security operations. Clients in the field have expressed the following pain points: "We can't store and analyze all data, resulting in blind spots." Limited storage and analysis capabilities prevent organizations from capturing and analyzing all relevant data, leading to blind spots in their security operations. "It’s cost prohibitive to ingest all the data we need." Organizations struggle with the sheer volume of data generated by their environments, making it challenging and costly to collect and analyze all the necessary information for effective security monitoring. "It takes too long to investigate alerts." Manual investigation processes and a lack of automation lead to time-consuming investigations, causing delays in identifying and addressing security incidents. "We struggle to build effective detection and have too many false positives/negatives." Organizations find it challenging to develop accurate and actionable detection mechanisms, leading to an overwhelming number of false positives and false negatives that impede their ability to identify real threats. "Our processes are too manual; we are too slow to respond to and remediate threats." Manual processes and a lack of automation hinder the speed and agility required to respond effectively to security incidents, leading to extended response times and delayed remediation. "We don't have enough skilled engineers to make everything work." The shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals poses a significant challenge, as organizations struggle to find and retain talent with the necessary expertise to manage and optimize security operations. These real-world challenges highlight the urgent need for transformation in security operations. Throughout this section, we will explore innovative approaches, technologies, and strategies that can address these pain points and empower organizations to overcome the limitations of traditional security operations. The traditional concept of a Security Operations Center (SOC) has its limitations and often falls short in meeting the evolving needs of modern cybersecurity. Let’s explore the key attributes of a legacy SOC, highlighting the challenges it poses and the reasons why we need to shift our focus towards security operations as a function, rather than simply relying on a centralized room with analysts staring at screens. The attributes of a legacy "SOC" include: Reactive instead of proactive approach to security: Legacy SOCs tend to be more reactive in nature, primarily responding to incidents after they occur rather than adopting a proactive stance to prevent or mitigate potential threats. Siloed organization and lack of communication between teams: Traditional SOCs often operate in silos, with limited collaboration and communication between different security teams and departments, hindering the overall effectiveness of security operations. Manual processes for security operations: Legacy SOCs heavily rely on manual processes, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and limit the speed and efficiency of incident response. Heavy centralized and reliance on human analysts: Traditional SOCs are often centered around a centralized team of human analysts, which can lead to bottlenecks, limited scalability, and dependencies on individual expertise. Limited automation and use of technology: Legacy SOCs may have limited automation capabilities, relying heavily on manual processes and underutilizing technology and automation tools that could enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Focus on compliance rather than actual security threats: Traditional SOCs may prioritize compliance requirements over proactive threat detection and response, which can result in a reactive approach that falls short in addressing evolving cyber threats. And the final attribute of a legacy "SOC" is limited visibility into security posture and risks. Legacy SOCs may lack comprehensive visibility into the organization's security posture and risks, making it challenging to proactively detect and respond to emerging threats. To meet the challenges of today’s threat landscape, it is crucial to move beyond the legacy concept of a SOC and focus on transforming security operations into a more agile, proactive, and integrated function. In the upcoming slides, we will explore the principles and strategies of modern security operations that enable organizations to overcome the limitations of a legacy SOC and embrace a more effective and resilient approach to cybersecurity. Remember how we discussed the five key strategic questions to place on top of your Security Operations program in Module 1? Let’s call these the 5 Es. It’s too expensive, quantifying efficacy is difficult, there’s oftentimes a lack of efficiency, there aren’t enough security resources and there’s an overburdened amount of time on existing security employees. All five of these Es aggregate into the total business impact. One of the significant challenges faced by security operations is the lack of collaboration with the business. This divide often stems from security being perceived as a cost center rather than a strategic business enabler. Let’s explore the implications of this gap and the importance of bridging it to achieve a more effective and integrated security posture. Within many organizations, security operations are viewed primarily as a cost center, focusing on compliance and risk management rather than as a business enabler. This perspective can lead to a disconnect between security teams and other business units, resulting in limited collaboration and communication. The lack of collaboration with the business has several consequences: Limited influence: Without strong collaboration, security operations struggle to have a meaningful impact on strategic decisions and initiatives within the organization. This can hinder the alignment of security goals with business objectives and prevent security from being integrated into the core fabric of the organization. Inadequate resource allocation: When security is seen merely as a cost center, resource allocation for security operations may be insufficient. This can hinder the ability to invest in the necessary tools, technologies, and skilled personnel needed to effectively manage security risks. Missed opportunities: A lack of collaboration prevents security operations from understanding the unique challenges and requirements of different business units. This can result in missed opportunities to provide tailored security solutions, proactive threat intelligence, and strategic guidance that align with specific business objectives. Reactive security posture: Without collaboration, security operations may find themselves in a reactive state, addressing security incidents and vulnerabilities after they have already occurred, rather than proactively anticipating and preventing potential threats. Limited business engagement: The perception of security operations as a separate and isolated function can hinder engagement with business stakeholders. This can prevent security from being included in critical decision-making processes, leading to security gaps and missed opportunities to address emerging risks. Bridging the divide between security operations and the business is essential for establishing a collaborative and integrated approach to cybersecurity. By fostering collaboration, engaging with business stakeholders, and positioning security as a strategic enabler, organizations can enhance their security posture, effectively manage risks, and align security goals with overall business objectives. Let’s examine how Google approaches the challenges posed by the 5 Es: Efficiency, Employee Shortage, Employee Burnout, Expensive, and Efficacy. While Google’s practices may seem aspirational, they provide valuable insights and inspiration for adopting Autonomic Security Operations (ASO) in the average enterprise. Let’s explore how to leverage these insights to enhance your security operations. For Efficiency: Google’s strong automation culture and emphasis on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) set a benchmark for efficiency.

Hey. Awesome. Great job on Week 2. Most of that information should have probably been somewhat old information for you. I mean, if you've been in the industry, if you've been doing security operations, a lot of this would look familiar to you by now. But again, there's been people who've been analysts their whole lives, whole careers, and probably never had worked directly in the data engineering component, the people who manage the tooling and infrastructure and ingesting logs and all the complexities that bring or even the incident responders who follow a very different methodology and structure to their work. Again, a lot of that was just context to really help level set and align on the non-negotiables of the work. Remember, if If you need to protect a bank, let's go back into physical security temps, if you need to protect a bank and the first part of it is, you need to have visibility, you need to have instrumentation into where the potential robbers can be so you need to understand A, do you have cameras at places? B, do you have card readers that are scanning for employee badges? C, do you have man traps, and do you have all of the different devices and structures in place? Are you logging all of that data into some centralized way for you to be able to monitor them? Because if you've got cameras, but guess what, you're not ingesting the feeds into an area where people can monitor them or a tool can be developed to monitor an alert on potential anomalies, well, then you're running blind. That same construct applies here. But the differences here is that the types of cameras we need to monitor our environments are just ever so complex. I mean, the instrumentation needed for different data types, the value of different data sources, if you're working in a Kubernetes environment or a standard VM-based environment or you've got third party tools that where the vendor doesn't really even give you the right data to be able to identify whether something bad is going on, this is like foundational table stakes information that you got to understand. Every time you are basically working on a potential use case, just remember that someone somewhere had to figure out, do we have the right visibility, the right data to even be able to detect whether something bad were to happen? Great, you've got visibility. Hopefully you're optimizing the types of logs you need because a lot of logs are useful and wasteful, and Sims cost a lot of money. But then the second part of this is great. Now, do you have a way of building all of your detection capabilities, the right type, the quality, and the sophistication of the types of detection for different types of adversarial events? Hopefully your detections are powered by both frameworks like MITRE and also with intelligence that you're getting from the front line so you're getting really, really close to your adversary. In one regard, it's blanket coverage across types of environments. In another regard, it's targeted insights of adversarial movements, that way you can validate that you have the detections in place. Also, testing whether those work in the first place, because many times, we all know, false positives are plentiful in this space and a lot of security operations teams have like a 92-95% level of false positives. I mean, think about it. We go report to the board, hey, we had 30,000 alerts this month or this quarter, we had two incidents out of those. Two things we worked on we think were real adversaries and the rest of them were just potentially false positives or bad data, bad process. It's running really, really inefficiently. Great. You start to build that detection capabilities. Great your detections are being tested, they're firing, you're monitoring them. The team that's monitoring them is doing a bit of triage. They're making sure they're trying to vet the right types of alerts that way. They don't have to pull in the instant responders as they're finite. There's only a couple of them, usually, or they might even be outsourced. Like paring down that needle in the haystack analogy to really trying to validate that you found the needle already is a complex feet of its own. Then finally, great, you vetted your escalation process and then there's instant responders that have to now figure out how to bring order to the chaos, and hopefully protect and prevent a lot of damage from occurring by potentially thwarting the attackers before they execute their mission or mitigating the type of the quantity of impact, the magnitude of impact that they're able to do and managing the public perception. For some high profile cases, there's lawyers involved, there's PR involved, there's governments involved, different regulatory requirements. I mean, this whole process is super sophisticated. If you notice the one theme I have here is that there's so many different people involved at all different layers of the chain. We didn't even talk about management. Because now management is going to be up your ear everywhere trying to figure out how they can get the right data so they can surface the right reports to their management. Ultimately, the C-suites management is the board and at some point, all of this data gets aggregated to a place or they can give the board some actionable data that shows that they're doing their due diligence in protecting the organization and all of their end users. Wow, that is Security Operations 101 and for smaller organizations, this is sometimes entirely outsourced. For other organizations, especially digital natives, oftentimes let the developers and the engineers take on all of the responsibilities here running in a bit of a federated distributed fashion. I mean, Netflix was a great example of how they built this socles hierarchy. But that model worked for Netflix and it will be really challenging to execute for some other organizations like this Taka Disney who might be a combination of dozens of old and new companies all in one. Then at some point, you got to think about this. If you are the CISO of your organization, which type of model works best for you and how do you get your organization both top down and bottom up aligned and inspired to this vision that you have? Because at some point we all know the average CISO 10 year is about 18 months. It takes 18 months to even run a successful project in the first place. Now, imagine trying to pick up steam from all of the people in your organization, from your new hires, just everything while also trying to manage your operational process, that's such a challenging thing and so that's why it is what I like to call the combination, the sum of the total. It is the involvement of the whole team in basically aligning themselves to this mentality that'll allow something like this to succeed. As we get into the ASO chapter, you're going to learn a lot about philosophical elements of this and how this had also helped in other parts of IT such as the advent of DevOps and how that philosophy had really helped change software delivery, reliability, and velocity for developers. That was a lot of stuff. I said I was going to keep this short. But every now and then, I'll throw some new bits of data for you. Folks, take care, see you on the next week.

Four key topics are examined in this section. First, some lessons learned around DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering are shared, how this transformed software development, and how you can implement these practices in SecOps. Next, we dive into key goals and objectives for ASO-oriented SecOps teams. Then we discuss the principles of ASO, to ensure you’re rooted in understanding how these principles apply to your everyday job. Lastly, we discuss transforming people, process, and technology into the ASO model. Let’s explore the reasons why DevOps, a collaborative approach that combines development and operations practices, is a valuable framework to consider in the context of Autonomic Security Operations. By understanding the capabilities and benefits of DevOps, we can leverage its principles to drive better software delivery, operational performance, and ultimately, improved business outcomes. DevOps is a collaborative approach that emphasizes close collaboration between development and operations teams, with a focus on automating processes, improving communication, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. It enables organizations to deliver software changes quickly and reliably, while maintaining stability and quality. DevOps encompasses various capabilities that can significantly enhance software delivery and operational performance. These capabilities can be categorized into three main areas: technical, process, and cultural. In the technical domain, DevOps emphasizes leveraging cloud infrastructure, shifting left on security (DevSecOps), and adopting continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) practices. These technical capabilities enable organizations to achieve greater agility, scalability, and efficiency in their software development and operations processes. DevOps also emphasizes process improvements, such as working in small batches, streamlining change approval processes, and ensuring visibility of work in the value stream. By optimizing these processes, organizations can minimize bottlenecks, increase efficiency, and improve overall workflow management. The cultural aspects of DevOps are equally important. A generative, trust-based culture promotes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a learning mindset. Transformational leadership plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. These capabilities of DevOps translate into better software delivery and operations performance, which can be measured using key performance indicators (KPIs). Velocity is measured by metrics such as lead time for changes and deployment frequency. DevOps practices enable organizations to deliver software changes quickly and frequently, accelerating time-to-market. Stability is measured by metrics like time to restore service and change failure rate. DevOps practices aim to minimize disruptions, improve incident response time, and reduce the rate of failed changes. Reliability encompasses the overall dependability and resilience of systems and services. DevOps practices contribute to increased reliability, ensuring consistent and high-quality delivery of software solutions. Ultimately, the capabilities and benefits of DevOps enable organizations to achieve better business outcomes. These outcomes can include improved market share, increased profitability, and enhanced employee retention, among others. DevOps provides a proven framework to enhance software delivery, operations performance, and business outcomes. By drawing inspiration from DevOps principles, we can drive similar improvements in the realm of Autonomic Security Operations. Harness the power of DevOps to transform your security operations and drive meaningful results. Let’s explore how DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Security Operations (SecOps) fit into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Understanding their placement within the SDLC helps recognize the distinct roles and responsibilities of each discipline and highlights the nature of SecOps as a reactive function. In the SDLC, we can identify the applicability of DevOps, SRE, and SecOps across different phases, following a chronological order from business to product to development to testing to deployment and finally operations. DevOps is a holistic approach that spans across all phases of the SDLC. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery, ensuring a smooth and efficient software SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering, comes into play after the development phase. SRE focuses on ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance of production systems. It involves practices such as monitoring, incident response, and capacity planning to maintain a reliable and efficient operational environment. SecOps typically comes into the picture after the operation phase. SecOps teams play a crucial role in detecting and responding to security incidents and threats. Their responsibilities include monitoring security logs, analyzing data for indicators of compromise, and implementing incident response procedures. By understanding the placement of DevOps, SRE, and SecOps within the SDLC, the distinct functions and responsibilities of each discipline can be appreciated. While DevOps and SRE focus on driving efficiency and reliability throughout the development and operational processes, SecOps brings a reactive security function, stepping in to detect and respond to threats once systems are operational. This understanding sets the stage for exploration of Autonomic Security Operations, which aims to transform the reactive nature of SecOps into a proactive and automated approach. Let's examine the concept of CI/CD and its significance in software development. CI/CD is an approach that enables organizations to deliver software changes quickly, reliably, and efficiently. By understanding the key aspects and business value of CI/CD, we can appreciate its role in accelerating time-to-market and enhancing software quality. CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, is a software development approach that emphasizes frequent code changes, automated testing, and the continuous delivery of software changes to production environments. It enables organizations to quickly and efficiently release new features, bug fixes, and improvements to their software. With CI/CD, developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. Automated testing processes are then triggered to ensure that the code changes do not introduce regressions or errors. Once the code passes the tests, it undergoes a continuous deployment process, where it is automatically deployed to production environments, making the changes immediately available to end-users. The business value of CI/CD is significant. By adopting this approach, organizations can achieve faster time-to-market, as new features and enhancements can be delivered more rapidly. CI/CD also improves software quality by catching issues early through automated testing and reducing the risk of introducing errors into production. This, in turn, leads to increased customer satisfaction and the ability to respond quickly to changing market demands. CI/CD plays a crucial role in modern software development, enabling organizations to deliver software changes efficiently, reliably, and with high quality. Its ability to accelerate time-to-market, enhance customer satisfaction, and respond to market demands makes it a valuable approach for any software development team. Let’s delve into the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Google. SRE is a unique approach that combines the mindset and practices of software engineering with the operations aspect of managing reliable systems. Understanding the principles behind SRE and its alignment with the concept of reliability will shed light on its significance in modern operations teams. SRE at Google is guided by three fundamental principles: The most important feature of any system is its reliability. SRE places a strong emphasis on the reliability of systems, recognizing its critical role in delivering a seamless user experience, and meeting business objectives. Our monitoring doesn’t decide our reliability, our users do. SRE recognizes that true reliability is determined by how users perceive and interact with the system. Monitoring serves as a valuable tool, but the ultimate measure of reliability is the experience of the users themselves. Well-engineered software can only get you 99.9%, well-engineered operations can get 99.99%, and only a well-engineered business can get 99.999%. SRE understands that achieving higher levels of reliability requires not only well-designed software but also well-executed operational practices. Continually improving operations and aligning them with business goals can push reliability to even greater levels. As Benjamin Treynor Sloss, Vice President of 24x7 Engineering at Google, once said: "SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team." This quote encapsulates the essence of SRE, highlighting the combination of software engineering principles with operational excellence to create a robust and reliable operations team. SRE at Google represents a transformative approach to operations, driven by a focus on reliability and the blending of software engineering practices with operational expertise. As we explore Autonomic Security Operations, drawing inspiration from SRE can help optimize security operations. Let’s explore the core principles of Site Reliability Engineering. These principles provide a foundation for building reliable systems and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. By embracing these principles, you can enhance your operations and strive for excellence in Autonomic Security Operations. Bridge all silos: SRE aims to reduce organizational silos and foster shared ownership. Breaking down barriers between teams enables effective collaboration and collective responsibility for system reliability. Blameless culture: SRE promotes a blameless culture where the focus is on identifying flaws in processes rather than blaming individuals. By shifting the perspective to process improvement, you can create a psychologically safe environment that encourages learning from failures. Strive for continuous improvement: SRE emphasizes embracing change, reducing the cost of failure, and minimizing Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). Continuous improvement is a key driver in enhancing system reliability and efficiency. Reduce toil: Toil refers to repetitive and manual tasks that can be automated. SRE advocates for automating such tasks to free up valuable time and resources. The goal is to cap toil work at 50% to allow for more meaningful and impactful work. Measure everything: Measurement plays a crucial role in SRE. By capturing relevant metrics and data, you gain insights into system behavior, performance, and reliability. Measurement helps make informed decisions and drive improvements. Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs): SRE introduces the concept of SLOs, which are agreed-upon targets for desired reliability. SLOs provide a principled way to measure and monitor system performance, aligning with business goals and user expectations. By embracing these SRE principles, you can lay a strong foundation for Autonomic Security Operations. Breaking down silos, fostering a blameless culture, driving continuous improvement, reducing toil, measuring everything, and defining clear SLOs empower you to build reliable and efficient security operations. In the journey towards Autonomic Security Operations, it’s important to understand the dynamics of transformation. The J Curve of transformation illustrates the path from low performance to excellence, highlighting key factors that influence progress. Let’s explore the different points on this curve. Teams begin transformation and identify quick wins: At the beginning of the transformation journey, teams start by identifying quick wins and implementing initial changes. These early wins serve as a foundation for further progress. Automation helps low performers progress to medium performers: Automation plays a pivotal role in driving transformation. It enables low-performing teams to leverage automated processes, reducing manual efforts and improving efficiency. As a result, they progress from being low performers to medium performers. Automation increases test requirements, which are dealt with manually: As automation is implemented, the need for thorough testing also increases. However, in some cases, organizations may still handle these test requirements manually, leading to potential bottlenecks and slower progress in the transformation. Technical debt and increased complexity slow down progress: As organizations face technical debt and encounter increased complexity, they may experience challenges in their transformation journey. These challenges often result in the introduction of additional manual controls and layers of process around changes, slowing down work and impeding progress. Relentless improvement work leads to excellence and high performance: Teams committed to relentless improvement and a culture of learning can achieve excellence and high performance. By continuously optimizing processes, learning from their environment, and embracing change, they can experience significant jumps in productivity and performance. Understanding the J-curve of transformation allows you to navigate the challenges and opportunities on your path towards Autonomic Security Operations. By identifying quick wins, embracing automation, addressing technical debt, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, you can progress towards excellence and high performance. Autonomic Security Operations (ASO) is a framework of practices and principles that promote continuous improvement of an organization's ability to withstand modern security attacks through an adaptive, agile, and highly automated approach to threat management. Autonomic Security Operations represents an evolution in cybersecurity strategy. In the spirit of DevOps, ASO emphasizes the need for seamless collaboration, agile methodologies, and an automation-first mindset to ensure the rapid detection and response to cyber threats. This approach fosters a cyber-resilient environment that can anticipate, withstand, recover, and evolve from security attacks. It advocates for a proactive and highly adaptive approach to threat management that is deeply ingrained in the DNA of an organization's operational fabric. At its core, ASO seeks to build a security posture that is as dynamic and complex as the threats it defends against, creating an ecosystem where security operations are not a reactive function, but an autonomic one, organically aligning with the ever-changing landscape of people, processes, and technologies. In the pursuit of enhanced security operations, Google has developed CD/CR - Continuous Detection, Continuous Response. This methodology operates in tandem with CI/CD and DevSecOps, providing a fully contextualized SecOps approach. Let’s explore the four core functions of CD/CR within its feedback loop. Data Visibility: CD/CR starts with comprehensive data visibility. It involves the collection, aggregation, and analysis of security data from various sources across the organization. This data visibility enables a holistic view of the security landscape and serves as the foundation for effective detection and response. Security Analytics: The CD/CR framework leverages advanced security analytics capabilities. Through machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data-driven insights, it enables the identification of patterns, anomalies, and indicators of compromise. Security analytics empower security teams to detect threats more effectively and make informed decisions. Response Orchestration: CD/CR emphasizes the orchestration of response actions. When a potential threat is identified, the framework provides a structured and automated process for coordinating and executing response activities. This includes incident triage, containment, eradication, and recovery, with the goal of minimizing the impact of security incidents. Continuous Feedback: The CD/CR framework fosters a culture of continuous feedback and improvement. It emphasizes the importance of learning from incidents, refining detection and response strategies, and enhancing security operations over time. Continuous feedback enables organizations to adapt to evolving threats and challenges effectively. CD/CR is a powerful framework that complements CI/CD and DevSecOps practices. By ensuring data visibility, leveraging security analytics, orchestrating response actions, and embracing continuous feedback, organizations can establish a robust and proactive approach to security operations. CD/CR enables a continuous and contextualized security posture, empowering organizations to effectively detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats. To ensure a cohesive and effective security operations approach, the CD/CR framework seamlessly integrates with the CI/CD process. Let’s explore how CI/CD loops into CD/CR and loops back into CI/CD to create a continuous and contextualized security ecosystem. As the CI/CD process reaches the Operate stage, an arrow points towards the "Visibility" function of CD/CR. This integration enables the ingestion and analysis of security data from the operational environment. By incorporating and driving a high level of automation of security visibility at this stage, organizations gain real-time insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities, enhancing their ability to detect and respond effectively. The CD/CR framework emphasizes "Continuous Feedback" as a crucial function. In this phase, organizations gather insights and lessons learned from security incidents and responses. An arrow points back from the "Continuous Feedback" function of CD/CR to the Monitor phase of CI/CD. This feedback loop enables organizations to refine their security strategies, improve their detection and response capabilities, and enhance their overall security posture. Across all of these phases there is a strong requirement for cross-functional, cross-organizational collaboration and alignment on how products are developed, how standards are defined, how automation is implemented, and how organizations drive improvement to allow teams to remain vigilant and agile. The integration of CI/CD with CD/CR creates a powerful synergy within the security operations framework. By incorporating security visibility into the Operate stage of CI/CD and establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement, organizations can effectively address security concerns throughout the software development lifecycle. This integration ensures that security is not an afterthought but an inherent part of the development and operational processes, leading to enhanced security outcomes and proactive risk mitigation.

Take 5 minutes to consider which of the following introduces toil in your SecOps. Remember, toil is “the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.” If your service remains in the same state after you have finished a task, the task was probably toil. Pause the video now and resume when you have finished. Here are some things to consider that introduce toil in your SecOps? How did you do?

- [YouTube: ASO Principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7bm-57N14o)

Now, let’s move on to the principles of ASO. ASO principles act as a guiding light, influencing managers and teams to adopt practices and strategies that align with the desired outcomes. They provide a shared set of values and beliefs that shape the mindset and behavior of individuals and teams involved in security operations. This alignment fosters collaboration, coordination, and a sense of collective responsibility, driving the transformation towards its intended goals. Moreover, the principles of ASO help create a consistent and transparent approach to security operations. By having a clear and agreed-upon set of principles, managers and teams can evaluate and assess their progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that the transformation stays on track. It facilitates communication, decision-making, and problem-solving, promoting a culture of continuous learning and growth. Let’s explore these principles. Reduce toil: ASO aims to automate repetitive and manual tasks, freeing up time for more valuable and strategic activities. By minimizing toil, security teams can focus on proactive work and critical security tasks. Embrace change: ASO embraces a mindset of continuous improvement and agility. It encourages security teams to adapt to evolving threats, technologies, and business needs, enabling them to stay ahead of potential risks. Strive for continuous improvement: ASO promotes a culture of ongoing learning and enhancement. It encourages security teams to regularly evaluate their processes, technologies, and strategies, seeking opportunities for optimization and refinement. Bridge all silos: ASO fosters collaboration and cooperation across different teams and departments involved in security operations. It breaks down organizational silos, promoting shared ownership and collective responsibility for security outcomes. Use service level objectives: ASO leverages service level objectives (SLOs) as a means to define and measure the desired reliability and performance of security operations. SLOs provide a clear framework for setting goals and monitoring progress. Avoid hero mentality: ASO encourages a shift from individual heroics to collective collaboration. It emphasizes teamwork and knowledge-sharing, creating an environment where success is a result of collective effort rather than individual achievements. Aim for simplicity: ASO advocates for simplicity in processes, technologies, and workflows. It seeks to eliminate unnecessary complexity, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall efficiency of security operations. In addition to the principles, it is important to be aware of the pitfalls that ASO should avoid. Restrict hiring to top professionals: ASO recognizes the value of diverse perspectives and experiences. It encourages organizations to consider a broader range of talent and provide opportunities for growth and development. Require an engineering-only culture: ASO values the contributions of different roles and disciplines.

### Video - [Service Level Objectives](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504235)

- [YouTube: Service Level Objectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0HP-B1z46A)

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) play a critical role in measuring and maintaining the reliability of a service. By setting specific targets and monitoring key indicators, organizations can ensure that their security operations meet the expected level of performance. To understand the concept of SLOs, let’s divide it into three components. A service level objective, SLO, is a target measure that defines how reliable a service is expected to be. It sets the performance goals for the service, taking into account the agreed upon SLA and the specific needs of the organization. SLOs provide a tangible benchmark to assess the effectiveness of the security operations and drive continuous improvement. A service level indicator, SLI, is a carefully defined quantitative metric that provides insights into the health and performance of a service. It serves as a measurement tool to assess whether an SLO is being met. SLIs can be based on various metrics, such as response time, availability, or incident response rate. A service level agreement, SLA, is an explicit or implicit legal contract that defines the expectations and consequences if a service fails to meet the promised target SLO. It outlines the agreed upon service levels between the service provider and the customer, ensuring transparency and accountability. In the context of Security Operations, an example of an SLO could be the mean time to detect and respond to a security incident. The organization may set a target SLO of detecting and responding to incidents within a specific timeframe, such as 30 minutes. The corresponding SLI could be the actual time taken to detect and respond to incidents, measured and tracked through monitoring and incident response tools. By implementing SLOs in Security Operations, organizations can effectively measure the reliability and performance of their security processes. SLOs provide a framework for setting clear targets, monitoring performance, and driving improvements. By continuously refining and meeting SLOs, organizations can enhance their security operations and ensure a higher level of protection for their systems and data. Remember, SLOs are an essential part of maintaining the expected level of service in Security Operations, enabling organizations to meet their security objectives and deliver value to their stakeholders. Now let’s consider an example that demonstrates how Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) can be applied in the context of Autonomic Security Operations. This example focuses on the use of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response, or SOAR, playbooks to enhance the detection and response capabilities. The SLI in this example is the "% of Detection Use Cases with SOAR Playbook." It measures the proportion of detection use cases within the security operations that have a corresponding SOAR playbook in place. This SLI provides visibility into how well the security operations team has incorporated automation and orchestration for detection purposes. The corresponding SLO is "90% of High Priority Use Cases have SOAR Playbook." This SLO sets the target for ensuring that a significant majority (90%) of high-priority use cases, which are critical security scenarios, have a dedicated SOAR playbook available. By meeting this SLO, the organization ensures that a robust automation-driven response is in place for the most critical security incidents. Let’s say an organization that has identified 20 high priority use cases based on their impact and risk level. The SLO states that 90% of these high priority use cases should have a dedicated SOAR playbook. This means that at least 18 out of the 20 identified use cases should have a corresponding playbook developed and integrated into the security operations workflow. To measure the SLI, the organization tracks the total number of detection use cases and calculates the percentage that has a corresponding SOAR playbook. This provides insights into the level of automation and orchestration applied to the detection phase of security operations. By setting SLIs and SLOs related to specific ASO metrics, such as the presence of SOAR playbooks, organizations can drive the adoption of automation and enhance the effectiveness of their security operations. These SLIs and SLOs provide clear targets, facilitate monitoring and evaluation, and ensure that critical security use cases are well supported by automation-driven playbooks. Remember, the use of SLIs and SLOs helps organizations measure their progress, optimize their security operations, and continuously improve their security posture. It aligns the security team’s efforts with desired outcomes and promotes a proactive and efficient approach to security incident detection and response.

The influence aspect of security operations is currently facing several challenges that need to be addressed. Let’s take a closer look at the current state of influence and the areas that require improvement. Security lessons learned not shared with other departments. This challenge stems from a lack of effective knowledge sharing and communication between security teams and other departments. Without proper sharing of security insights and best practices, there is a limited collective understanding of security risks and mitigation strategies within the organization. Security is not treated as a business enabler. In some cases, security is viewed as a hindrance or an additional burden rather than a strategic enabler for the business. This mindset can result in a misalignment between security objectives and overall business goals, compromising the effectiveness of security initiatives. No threat modeling development practices. The absence of threat modeling practices hampers the identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. Without proper threat modeling, organizations become more vulnerable to attacks and exploitation. Lack of integration with DevOps practices. Security operations often operate separately from DevOps practices, creating a gap between security requirements and the fast-paced development and deployment cycles. This disconnect can lead to security being an afterthought or retroactively addressed, rather than being seamlessly integrated into the development process. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to prioritize influence within security operations. By addressing the gaps in knowledge sharing, treating security as a business enabler, implementing threat modeling practices, and integrating security with DevOps processes, organizations can create a culture where security plays a vital and influential role. In the upcoming slides, we explore how ASO can help organizations achieve these goals and drive effective security operations. The influence aspect of security operations requires transformation to achieve a greater impact and alignment with the business. Let’s explore the 10X transformation for influence, organized into tactical, strategic, and transformational phases. In the tactical phase, focus on building collaborative processes with project owners to drive action. Train and educate your team on the lifecycle of threats to enhance their understanding and response capabilities. Ensure tight integration between SecOps and the vulnerability management team to effectively address vulnerabilities. Utilize SecOps metrics to demonstrate the business value of security and drive influence across the organization. In the strategic phase, aim to automate feedback loops to empower project owners to take proactive action. Align skills-based SecOps leads with DevOps and Architecture subject matter experts to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. Automate vulnerability enrichment through alerts to streamline the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities. Treat security threats as risks to the bottom line and educate the SecOps team on the business value of security to enhance their influence and decision-making. In the transformational phase, focus on automating response actions to minimize the volume of alerts handled by SecOps. Establish security champions who collaborate with the SecOps team and contribute to governance, risk management, and compliance efforts. Automate feedback loops between IT and vulnerability teams to expedite patching of zero-day and high-priority threat vectors. Integrate CI/CD and CD/CR to bridge the gap between business requirements and operational security. By undergoing the 10X transformation for influence, organizations can elevate the role of security operations and drive greater alignment with the business. Through collaborative processes, automation, skill alignment, and integration, security operations can become a trusted partner in achieving business objectives and managing risks effectively. The following modules delve further into the ASO framework and how it enables organizations to realize these transformational goals in their security operations.

Great job. You did it. Congrats on nailing the week on autonomic security operations, which, again, like I said, was the philosophical aspects of the work, which can be the most important parts of your job, right? Because if you take two people, let's say one person is more technically apt and one person is more of a process optimization automation type of person, right? And one person is able to go and solve all of the technical challenges that are needed faster. And so they're really useful because we always have these tons of different problems, from blind spots to the wrong instrumentation, to tooling issues to, you know, false positives within the logs to bad detections, right? If one person is really good at being able to solve all of these fires, because all these end up becoming fires, right? But another person is like, you know what? I'm just going to figure out how to drive and engineer this process that way we never see this problem again. And I'm going to go one by one, methodically approaching each one of these tasks that continue to be repetitive, right? It's toil. It's things that are repetitive. This toil some work, I'm going to automate them. Ultimately, at the end of the day, what you might find is you might have someone with a lot more skills and talent here, but you might find someone who's able to meaningfully drive a reduction in the amount of alerts that you see in the first place. So, this is the conscious approach we have to take, which is like, we have to really drive down alert fatigue. Because I hate to break it to you, but if there's 50 alerts a day, and you have two analysts that are looking at this, there's just no way that you're going to. Even if you were able to find the attacker, by the time you even get to finding, validating and trying to weed the attacker out, that mission has already been executed. Without an investment in efficiency, you will not find the time or the bandwidth to be able to prove that you are an effective team at detecting, weeding out, and reducing the risk for your organization. This is actually something that Google does very, very, very well. Our security engineering team, which, by the way, if you haven't seen their documentary on YouTube, go check it out. It's called Hacking Google. Really, really cool documentary, but this team is so talented because the way that they approached their work was a lot more like site reliability engineering than it was like traditional operations. The reason why was because we realized that if you don't prioritize efficiency, you will never have the time to focus on efficacy, period. So we want everyone to take from this module. What you want to take away from this is that when you go back to your work tomorrow, whatever your job is, just keep a pen and paper on you, or a Google Sheet or whatever it may be. And every time you do something repetitive, just write it down. Just write down. When you see repetitive actions happen, just write it all down, right? Once you start to see repetitive work, and you're aware of it, you bring it to your conscious. Then you're going to be able to figure out how you can solve for that repetition, right? Maybe what might end up happening is your VP is going to take your next role, your next open job instead of hiring another analyst. We'll go put a job wreck out for an automation engineer who might not be as skilled at security operations, but really knows process automation really well, or maybe they might be, hey, you know what? We're going to go and just tell everybody that, like, we're going to start to incentivize you to do less ops and maybe spend 10% or 20% of your week thinking about automation. Because the sum of like really focusing on efficiency, what it's going to do in the long term is it's going to lessen the burnout. It's going to lessen the amount of time that you have to spend that ends up going to waste because you ended up working on something that ended up being a false positive. It's going to give you more time to actually do security, and that's why we're all in this industry. We all come here to do security. We don't come here to do repetitive customer service, toilsome task-based work, validating the right details and the information, and pulling process logs and everything else. A lot of these things can be automated, so remember that. Prioritize your efficiency. Work with your team on having some type of metrics or way to objectively measure efficiency, that way, you all can play the long game. And as you hire more people, they're coming into a practice that gives them more time to shine and really utilize their skills towards more complex challenges. All right, so next week we're going to talk about continuous detection, continuous response. We're going to really dive into some concrete examples about how we are basically able to take tools like Chronicle SIEM and Chronicle SOAR and all of our capabilities and help customers focus on an intelligence driven approach to modernizing their security operations program. Obviously, as a product and as a platform, Google has a very opinionated approach of how we're doing this and how we're reducing the toil, both from an engineering perspective within the platform, but also from a workflow perspective for our end users, right? And so this learning you're going to get, hopefully, whether you use our products or not, is going to be relevant because there are ways in which you can use tools to do things more efficiently that you've never done before, right? I mean, last week I took a drill and I put a brush head on it, and I cleaned my bathtub with a brush head instead of scrubbing it by hand, right? Like, who would have thought? That same thing is possible in IT, right? [LAUGH] Anyways, have fun, prepare, enjoy, take the next week off, whatever you want to do. See you next time.

As we conclude our discussion on Autonomic Security Operations, let’s recap the key points we have covered. ASO is a natural evolution that draws from the lessons learned in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering. It leverages principles and practices to drive improvements in security operations. ASO moves away from legacy security practices and embraces the integration of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Continuous Detection/Continuous Response (CD/CR). This combination enables a streamlined and automated approach to security operations. ASO is guided by seven key principles: reducing toil, embracing change, striving for continuous improvement, bridging silos, using service level objectives, avoiding hero mentality, and aiming for simplicity. These principles serve as a foundation for driving transformation and achieving better security outcomes. ASO is not limited to just one aspect of security operations. It encompasses a holistic transformation that impacts people, process, technology, and influence within the organization. By addressing these areas, ASO creates a comprehensive and effective security operations framework. In summary, ASO represents a shift towards a more efficient, proactive, and integrated approach to security operations. By embracing the principles of DevOps, leveraging automation, and focusing on continuous improvement, organizations can transform their security operations and enhance their ability to protect against evolving threats. ASO empowers teams to be more effective, adaptable, and aligned with the strategic goals of the organization. We’ve now finished Module 3, which was a comprehensive overview of the Autonomic Security Operations approach at an organizational level. In our next module, Continuous Detection, Continuous Response, we’ll dive into more specifics to help you understand how to operationalize CD/CR in your practice.

## Continuous Detection, Continuous Response

Module 4 is focused on providing learners with a complete breakdown of the Continuous Detection, Continuous Response (CD/CR) methodology, including a deep dive into each function, examples of deployment pipelines, as well as access to labs that showcase these functions in a simulated environment.

### Video - [Module Objectives](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504245)

- [YouTube: Module Objectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWh18TR-BIM)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Autonomic Security Operations course. In this module, we discuss the Continuous Detection, Continuous Response (CD/CR) methodology and help you understand how you can build continuous pipelines across your security operations program. In this module, you learn to shift away from an assembly-line approach of managing threats, and adopt an agile operating model based on CD/CR. You also learn how to embrace the four core components to implement CD/CR. And learn how to lead your organization through change by building an ASO-based CD/CR culture. Shapor Naghibzadeh (pronounced Nah-geeb-zad-ey), the co-founder of Chronicle, outlines the vision of Chronicle and Google’s AI Security Workbench aligned to driving the industry towards ASO. Google has launched a slew of AI features and continues to build a roadmap towards automating and reducing toil from security operations in an effort to help defenders be ahead of the adversary. AI adoption will be a cornerstone in the journey to ASO.

### Video - [CD/CR Overview](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504246)

- [YouTube: CD/CR Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-dRW1C3Wns)

Our first topic focuses on a brief overview of CD/CR. Then we dive deeper into the key functions of CD/CR, and lastly we focus on integrating the CD/CR methodology across your organization’s culture. The success of DevOps and SRE in removing silos between software developers and operations teams has paved the way for a similar transformation in security operations. At the core of this transformation is the concept of Continuous Detection, Continuous Response (CD/CR). Just as CI/CD pipelines automate the software delivery process, CD/CR enables the automation of security operations to achieve rapid and reliable threat detection and response. CD/CR builds upon the principles of CI/CD, incorporating continuous monitoring, automation, and streamlined processes to enable efficient and effective security operations. By embracing CD/CR, organizations can ensure that their security teams are equipped with the tools and capabilities to swiftly detect and respond to threats, minimizing the risk of security breaches and enabling a proactive security posture. By leveraging automation and continuous monitoring, CD/CR simplifies the deployment of security measures, reducing the likelihood of errors and enhancing overall operational efficiency. This shift towards a more automated and continuous approach to security empowers organizations to stay one step ahead of evolving threats and enables them to respond swiftly and effectively. Just as CI/CD revolutionized software delivery, CD/CR is transforming security operations. By adopting the principles of continuous detection and response, organizations can enhance their security posture, mitigate risks, and enable a proactive and resilient security environment. Do you recall the slide in Module 3 on the business development lifecycle? The power of continuous improvement allows security operations to be further embedded in process that starts at the ideation of new business opportunities. This core focus on “shifting left” and driving influence through the development of CD/CR pipelines allows you to create new processes that allow your organization to integrate across the development lifecycle, further refining your ability to proactively protect your organization against threats. Let’s put this into context with a simple example. Say your SecOps team gets alerts on data exfiltration events from employees potentially exfiltrating confidential data to their USB drives. You can, as a SecOps team, work on refining the alerts to pinpoint which files are most likely confidential data to increase the true positive percentage of the alerts, or you can work with IT and implement a restriction on plugable USB drives. Now, all of those alerts are a thing of the past, and your SecOps team is no longer burdened with the toil of managing all of these data exfiltration events. This is a very simple example that many organizations have already solved, but it illustrates the power of continuous feedback and improvement in SecOps. By analyzing the alerts on data exfiltration events and taking proactive measures, such as refining the alerts and implementing USB drive restrictions, the SecOps team eliminates the burden of managing repetitive data exfiltration incidents. Now, imagine applying this concept to every type of alert your team deals with. Ask yourself the following questions: Are there specific patterns or indicators that can help us improve the accuracy and effectiveness of our alerts? Can we collaborate with other teams, such as IT, to implement preventive measures that eliminate or reduce the occurrence of certain alerts? How can we leverage automation and orchestration to streamline and expedite our response to alerts? Are there any feedback loops or metrics we can establish to continuously assess and enhance the performance of our alerting and response processes? By continuously asking these questions and seeking opportunities for improvement, your SecOps team can optimize its operations, enhance the overall security posture, and reduce the operational burden associated with managing alerts. In the realm of Continuous Detection and Continuous Response, the CD/CR infinity loop serves as a comprehensive framework for effective security operations. This lifecycle encompasses four key areas, each playing a crucial role in the continuous improvement and optimization of security practices. Data Visibility is the foundation of CD/CR, providing the necessary insights into the organization’s security landscape. This includes activities such as data discovery, instrumentation, pipeline deployment, and use case development. By ensuring comprehensive data coverage and effective data management, organizations can lay the groundwork for successful security analytics and response orchestration. Security Analytics focuses on leveraging the collected data to gain valuable insights and detect potential threats. This phase includes data aggregation, log retention, enrichment, threat detection, threat hunting, threat investigation, and scoring/prioritization. By applying advanced analytics techniques, organizations can identify anomalies, uncover hidden threats, and prioritize their response efforts based on the severity and impact of each threat. Response Orchestration aims to streamline and automate the incident response process. It involves playbook development, response automation, alert triage, case management, forensics capture, incident management, and incident response. By establishing predefined response workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and facilitating effective collaboration among security teams, organizations can improve their response capabilities and minimize the time to mitigate threats. Continuous Feedback serves as the feedback loop within the CD/CR infinity loop, enabling continuous improvement and learning. This includes the generation of dashboards and reports, conducting threat modeling exercises, implementing preventive controls and architecture enhancements, iterating on use cases, playbooks, and enrichment, performing blameless postmortems, tracking metrics and OKRs, conducting red and purple team exercises, and staying informed through ongoing threat research and intelligence. Additionally, a key aspect of continuous feedback is distributing security tasks upstream to increase scalability. By involving business units, development teams, and other stakeholders in the security feedback loop, organizations can leverage their expertise and resources to drive proactive security measures. This includes distributing security responsibilities, such as threat modeling, preventive controls implementation, and architecture enhancements, to the appropriate teams. This approach not only increases scalability but also fosters a culture of security ownership and collaboration throughout the organization. By continuously assessing performance, identifying areas for enhancement, and leveraging feedback from all stakeholders, organizations can enhance their security posture and adapt to evolving threats effectively. The CD/CR infinity loop emphasizes the importance of proactive engagement, scalability, and collaborative efforts in achieving continuous improvement in security operations. Through the CD/CR infinity loop, organizations can establish a robust and resilient security program that aligns with modern security practices and effectively safeguards their digital assets. By embracing this comprehensive lifecycle, organizations can navigate the evolving threat landscape with agility and confidence, driving continuous improvement, and maintaining a strong security posture.

### Video - [CD/CR Workflows](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504247)

- [YouTube: CD/CR Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TtEfXCo-0)

At the core of the CD/CR model are two key workflows: the engineering workflow and the operational workflow. Let’s examine them in turn. . The engineering workflow for CD/CR encompasses key stages that drive the development and deployment of effective security measures. This workflow ensures that organizations can proactively detect and respond to potential threats. The workflow follows a chronological order to achieve comprehensive security coverage. First is use case research and creation. Threat research conducts thorough research on emerging threats and attack techniques to stay ahead of potential risks. Threat qualification evaluates the identified threats based on their relevance, impact, and likelihood of occurrence. Log ingestion determines the critical log sources to be ingested for monitoring and analysis. Next is analytic development. Use case validation validates the effectiveness and accuracy of the use cases in detecting the identified threats. Rule-based development develops rule-based analytics to detect specific patterns and indicators of compromise. Model-based development employs machine learning models and algorithms to detect anomalies and behavioral patterns. Integration testing tests the developed analytics in a controlled environment to ensure seamless integration and proper functioning. And then there is response orchestration. Automation development develops automated response actions and playbooks to streamline the incident response process. Integration testing tests the integration of automated response actions with the security infrastructure to verify their effectiveness. Production deployment deploys the developed automation and response orchestration capabilities in the production environment. Across all three stages of the engineering workflow is threat hunting and enrichment. Threat hunting continuously searches for potential threats and indicators of compromise that may have evaded traditional detection mechanisms. Enrichment enhances the collected security data with additional contextual information, such as threat intelligence feeds or asset data, to improve the accuracy and efficacy of threat detection. By following the CD/CR engineering workflow, organizations can ensure the effective development, testing, and deployment of use cases, analytics, and response automation. This structured approach enables organizations to enhance their security capabilities and respond promptly to emerging threats in a proactive and efficient manner. The operational workflow for CD/CR focuses on the day-to-day execution of security operations and incident response. This workflow ensures that organizations can effectively triage alerts, respond to incidents, and continuously improve their security posture. First is alert triage. Dashboard creation develops customized dashboards to provide real-time visibility into security alerts and incidents. Investigation conducts in-depth investigations of alerts to determine their severity, impact, and potential risks. Confirmed incident identifies and confirms incidents that require immediate action and escalation. Next is incident response. Incident management manages and coordinates the overall incident response process, ensuring timely and effective actions are taken. Incident response executes predefined response procedures to contain and mitigate incidents, minimizing their impact. Forensics collection gathers and preserves digital evidence for further analysis and investigation. Recovery restore affected systems and services to their normal operation to minimize downtime and business impact. Blameless post-mortem conducts post-incident reviews to identify root causes, lessons learned, and opportunities for improvement, fostering a blameless culture. And then there is continuous feedback. IT/developer collaboration: collaborates with IT and development teams to implement security improvements and address vulnerabilities. Engineering enhancements: incorporate engineering enhancements, such as rule refinement or automation adjustments, to optimize the CD/CR workflow. Establish feedback loop: establishes a continuous feedback loop between security operations, engineering, and developer teams to share insights, lessons learned, and recommendations for process enhancements. Once again, across all three stages of the operational workflow is threat hunting and enrichment. By following the CD/CR operational workflow, organizations can efficiently manage security alerts, respond to incidents, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. This structured approach ensures that security operations are effective, proactive, and aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.

- [YouTube: Roles and Responsibilites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlZlJGUWWYc)

As part of the engineering workflow, we discussed rule-based development of analytics. Collaborating on and deploying security analytics as code is a key aspect of the CD/CR workflow, enabling organizations to leverage the benefits of automation, collaboration, and version control. This subcomponent focuses on streamlining the development, deployment, and monitoring of security analytics for effective threat detection and response. Start by creating a private repo. Establish a private repository to store and manage your organization’s security analytics codebase. Alternatively, leverage an open-source software (OSS) repository, such as Community Security Analytics, as a starting point to create analytics and fine-tune them based on your specific needs. Then collaborate with the team. Engage your team of security analysts, engineers, and stakeholders to collectively develop, quality assure (QA), and manage version control for the security analytics. Leverage collaborative platforms and processes to facilitate effective teamwork and knowledge sharing. Next, deploy analytics with automation. Utilize automation frameworks and tools to deploy the developed security analytics into your relevant security tools, such as SIEMs or threat detection platforms. Implement automation pipelines to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency across environments. Then alert on stale analytics and automate the workflow process. Establish mechanisms to identify and alert on stale or outdated security analytics. Automate the workflow to initiate the necessary updates, iterations, or retirements of analytics based on defined criteria and business requirements. And finally, develop metrics and dashboards. Create metrics and dashboards to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the detection-as-code process. Track key performance indicators (KPIs), such as detection rates, false positives, and mean time to deploy, to assess the overall efficiency and impact of the deployed analytics. By deploying security analytics as code, organizations can benefit from standardized, scalable, and auditable approaches to threat detection. This subcomponent promotes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, enabling teams to efficiently develop, deploy, and iterate on security analytics, leading to more effective and responsive security operations. Community Security Analytics is an open-source GitHub repository aimed at promoting community collaboration and knowledge sharing in the development of security analytics, automations, and more. It serves as a valuable resource for organizations seeking self-service security analytics capabilities to detect potential threats and audit data usage in Google Cloud workloads. Some of the key features include: Open-Source Queries and Rules Community Security Analytics provides a comprehensive set of open-source queries and rules that organizations can leverage to build their security analytics capabilities. These queries and rules are designed to help detect potential threats, identify security vulnerabilities, and monitor data usage within Google Cloud environments. Self-Service Security Analytics By utilizing the open-source queries and rules, organizations can empower their detection engineers, logging engineers, threat hunters, intelligence researchers, and data governance analysts to develop and fine-tune security analytics tailored to their specific needs. This self-service approach enables teams to quickly adapt and respond to emerging threats and evolving security requirements. Co-Development and Collaboration The Community Security Analytics repository fosters collaboration among security professionals and industry experts. Detection engineers, logging engineers, threat hunters, intelligence researchers, and data governance analysts can co-develop, share, and contribute analytics, automations, and insights, benefiting from collective expertise and diverse perspectives. Enhancing Security Capabilities By leveraging the shared knowledge and collective efforts within the community, organizations can enhance their security capabilities, improve threat detection accuracy, and strengthen their overall security posture. The repository serves as a platform for continuous learning, innovation, and the exchange of best practices in security analytics development. Community Security Analytics encourages an inclusive and collaborative approach to security analytics development, empowering organizations to leverage the expertise of the community to enhance their security operations. By engaging with the repository and contributing to its growth, organizations can benefit from a shared pool of knowledge and contribute to the broader goal of strengthening cybersecurity across industries. In Autonomic Security Operations teams, the focus is on skills and tasks rather than on rigid roles. This approach allows for flexibility in hiring and talent development, as well as resource allocation based on demand. The ASO team understands that these functions are critical for a well-rounded security program, and it is important to ensure that the necessary skills are covered by someone or multiple individuals within the team. This flexible approach allows for optimal utilization of skills and resources, enabling the team to adapt to changing demands and effectively address security challenges. Because the four pillars of the CD/CR form a pipeline, the work tasks are very intertwined. Someone working on any pillar can create work tasks to be handled by someone else working on another pillar. ASO skills and tasks are color coded so they match each of the four CD/CR pillars. Blue = Data Visibility Yellow = Security Analytics Red = Response Orchestration Green = Continuous Feedback While it is essential to have coverage for the five standard SOC roles, it doesn’t necessarily require a one-to-one mapping of individuals to each function. Regarding the skills needed, let’s elaborate on each one of the standard SOC roles. Log Collection Engineer: Expertise in configuring and managing log collection infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive and reliable data ingestion from various sources.

This holistic approach ensures that the team is well-equipped to handle various aspects of security operations and effectively respond to evolving threats. Each organization may have unique requirements and constraints that shape their approach to building an ASO team. While some organizations may have individuals who possess a wide range of skills and act as full-stack engineers, others may adopt a more specialized approach with a 1:1 mapping of skills to individuals. The power of the ASO framework lies in its ability to outline the necessary skills and functions while allowing organizations to determine the best approach for providing coverage. It recognizes that every organization is different, with varying resources, expertise, and culture. This flexibility enables organizations to build teams that align with their specific needs and leverage their existing talent pool effectively.

In our CD/CR model for continuous detection and response, we bring together people, processes, and technologies to build a robust security operations workflow. Let’s explore further into each aspect and how they contribute to an effective security ecosystem. For the process aspect, we have two key workflows that we discussed earlier. The engineering workflow encompasses use case research and creation, analytics development, and response orchestration. It starts with the initial qualification tool, which determines whether a threat warrants the creation of a use case. Once qualified, the continuous deployment pipeline is initiated, enabling the deployment of analytics and response automation. The operational workflow focuses on day-to-day operations and continuous feedback. Security analysts play a vital role in this workflow, performing activities such as alert triage, case management and investigation, and incident response. They provide valuable feedback to improve our detection and response capabilities. Within the process, there are specialized roles that align with each area of focus; this is the people aspect. In the engineering workflow, there is cyber threat engineering and log collection engineering, which contribute to the use case research and creation process. Their expertise helps identify and analyze threats, ensuring the development of effective use cases. Detection engineering is a critical role within the continuous deployment pipeline. These engineers leverage the data from disparate log sources and utilize the security data lake/SIEM to develop analytics. Their work enables efficient and accurate threat detection. Automation engineering focuses on building automated response capabilities. They leverage SOAR tools to create automated playbooks and response workflows that streamline incident response and reduce manual effort. Security analysts play a crucial role in day-to-day operations. They perform tasks such as alert triage, case management, and investigation. Their continuous feedback and insights help refine and improve our security processes. Supporting these processes and people are essential technologies that enable efficient and effective CD/CR. We start with the ingestion of data from disparate log sources, which provide the foundation for our security operations. This data is consolidated and analyzed within our security data lake/SIEM, empowering our detection engineers to develop advanced analytics and detection capabilities. SOAR tools play a crucial role in our automation engineering process. They enable the creation and management of automated playbooks and workflows, streamlining incident response and enabling faster, more effective actions.

To illustrate this in a real-world scenario, suppose there is a malicious email attachment. Here is an example of the engineering workflow that would take place. The workflow begins with use case research and creation. The Cyber Threat Engineering team, leveraging insights from Mandiant Threat Intelligence, conducts research on the latest email-based threats, including malicious attachments. They identify relevant indicators, attack techniques, and patterns associated with these threats. Based on their research, they create use cases in JIRA, outlining the specific criteria and logic for detecting malicious email attachments and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Analytics development then takes place. The Detection Engineering team leverages the use cases developed in JIRA and collaborates with previous teams to ensure that Chronicle SIEM, the organization’s security information and event management (SIEM) solution, is configured to ingest and process email data for analysis. They develop more complex analytics rules within Chronicle SIEM to detect sophisticated indicators of compromise and suspicious email behavior, as basic IOC’s consumed via threat intelligence are automatically IOC-matched within Chronicle. The analytics rules are fine-tuned based on the findings from the use cases in JIRA and aligned with the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the rules, Mandiant Security Validation is used to conduct live testing and ensure accurate detection in a real-world setting. Response orchestration is the next phase. The Automation Engineering team utilizes Chronicle SOAR, the security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform from Chronicle, integrated with JIRA and Chronicle SIEM. They develop playbooks within Chronicle SOAR to automate response actions for identified malicious email attachments. The playbooks incorporate actions such as isolating affected systems, notifying incident response teams, and updating the status of the use case tickets in JIRA. And here is an example of the operational workflow that would follow. Alert triage is the first thing to happen. Security Analysts receive alerts triggered by the analytics rules within Chronicle SIEM for potential malicious email attachments. They review and triage these alerts in Chronicle SIEM, assessing the severity and priority based on the predefined criteria and MITRE ATT&CK mappings. Analysts provide updates and track the progress of the use case tickets in JIRA as they handle and resolve the alerts. Case management and investigation follows. Analysts assigned to the case perform in-depth investigations on the suspicious email attachments using Chronicle SIEM, analyzing the events and associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques. They gather additional information, conduct analysis, and assess the potential impact of the attachments. The findings and actions taken during the investigation are documented and updated in the corresponding use case tickets in JIRA, including the relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Incident response is started. If the investigation confirms a security incident, the Incident Response team is engaged to contain, mitigate, and remediate the impact. They follow predefined response procedures, which are documented and tracked within JIRA, including the applicable MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Communication and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, such as IT teams and management, are coordinated through JIRA. And finally, continuous feedback is provided. Throughout the entire process, Security Analysts provide continuous feedback on the effectiveness of the use cases, analytics rules, and response playbooks. They provide their insights and observations in JIRA, allowing the engineering teams to refine the use cases, adjust the analytics rules, and improve the response playbooks, considering the MITRE ATT&CK mappings. This feedback loop within JIRA ensures that the engineering teams have visibility into the operational outcomes and can iteratively enhance the CD/CR pipeline, incorporating the knowledge gained from the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By leveraging Mandiant Threat Intelligence for research, Mandiant Security Validation for live testing, and incorporating their insights into the CD/CR workflow, organizations can enhance their understanding of the latest email-based threats and develop effective use cases.

Here we highlight the progression from ad hoc to periodic and continuous improvement in three areas: visibility, analytics, and response. We will also look at continuous feedback later. This involves ad hoc onboarding log sources during major tech transformations and reviewing logs for new sources when problems arise. As well as periodic onboarding log sources on a planned schedule, we want to periodically review data for new sources and issues/outages. After that, continuously onboard new log sources as they become available, real-time identification of changes, and automatic alert creation. For security analytics and response orchestration, a similar progression is followed, involving significant upfront efforts, periodic reviews, and continuous enhancements. By embracing these stages, organizations can enhance their security operations and achieve more effective detection and response capabilities. The progression in the continuous feedback area includes establishing and reviewing OKRs periodically or during leadership changes, manual metrics report generation, lessons learned after major security events, and occasional third-party penetration tests. And then performing monthly reviews of SecOps OKRs and performance metrics, automated metrics report generation, metrics driving strategic change, quarterly reviews of security incidents for lessons learned, and scheduled annual Purple Team exercises. Continuous feedback includes live dashboards showing real-time metrics and trends, leadership having access to live reports, metrics driving strategic change and influencing peer organizations, recording lessons learned for each incident at the time it occurs, and continuous attack simulations to test people, processes, and technology against real attacker techniques. By embracing continuous feedback, organizations can drive ongoing improvements in their security operations and enhance their overall security posture.

Great job. You did it. You got through CDCR, which is actually like the meat of ASO. The meat of ASO, the framework is about the methodology. It's about CDCR. CDCR, if you think about it, is basically taking what CICD did to software, the SDLC, the software development life cycle, and bringing that into the fold for security operations teams to truly implement an agile approach to streamlining their whole process. CDCR is going to be really difficult to achieve. As we mentioned, it's not a binary conversation. You don't buy a tool in tomorrow your CDCR. You don't buy a tool in tomorrow your DevOps. You don't buy things, and suddenly the process looks different. It takes a calculated approach both from the people that are getting hired to run all of these workflows to your managers who have to manage and incentivize the team to your VPs, who really need to structure the teams in a way that allows them to be agile. This agile methodology is going to be very crucial because the speed of change for technology is so fast. If we don't focus on being agile, we are in no way shape or form going to be able to keep up with all of the different changes that are going to come, this next year. Just taking into account like, most people are still struggling with understanding how to monitor Cloud environments because maybe, there's all these new services that pop up all the time, and not every service follows the same exact level of verbosity in the logs or even the guaranteed time of deliveries. In Cloud environments alone, and then you've got Kubernetes, which alone, you've got ephemeral infrastructure that basically can disappear on demand and guess what happens. If you try to find out how to detect logs in an environment that's ephemeral or detect adversaries, that's so challenging because by the time you find an adversary, I mean, that instance is gone, that traces of them are gone. It's not that easy. Because of this, it's not that easy, we really need you to take this approach, and you think of like the impact that microservices has had on the SDLC, which in many ways it's helped build products faster, iterate faster, better feedback loops, better reliability, faster features, better products, better customer service, all these things are so great. Also, in a way in 2024, we're starting to see the shift back towards maybe a different style of monolithic architectures in tandem or in conjunction with the shift to microservices. Even these infrastructure models of the past and of the present and of the future are so fluid, and we just need to be able to be very adaptive and adaptable to all of this change. Take CDCR and go just draw it out. Draw it out on a whiteboard. Pull a small team together because most of you are very operational and so it's going to be hard to take out the operational team and take them away from critical work, which could impact users and impact the company. But see if you can put together a small team to go and branch off as a 20% project, get into a room and just draw out your process, draw out where your critical assets are as an organization, how you have a process built to be able to gather the right type of data that you need to be able to defend those environments. How you're collaborating with the people that own those environments because, guess what, if there was a breach, an alert goes off across an affected environment, and you don't have a way of rapidly collaborating with the people that own and know that environment inside out, then that's also again, added time for someone to execute their mission. Anyway, food for thought. This is all food for thought for you to really just take and think about and try to spend some time in your work, just thinking about the work, the approach if you're doing things the right way. Don't be afraid to challenge. When you're younger in your careers, when you're more junior, when you're in a place that you're not comfortable with, you're more afraid to speak up. But in reality, like babies are the most creative people. Then when they become adults, they all become less creative because they think about the unthinkable. Babies think about the world as being something that isn't as defined and as rigid in structure. Sometimes when you're the most vulnerable as an individual, when you're the most vulnerable is potentially when you could provide one of the most unique perspectives on a problem. See you next week.

- [YouTube: Dr. Anton Chuvakin - Video - "Anton on ASO"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn1pD_XhB34)

Hello. This is Anton Chuvakin, and I wanted to provide some inspiration and perhaps a little bit of motivation about autonomic security operation and our approach to modern security operation or modern setups. Admittedly, a lot of people are on a quest for modernizing their socks, their security operation centers, or perhaps their detection and response teams. There's a bit of a quest for a modern sock, and a lot of people are ending up in a lot of unusual places. There are definitely people who are trying to optimize their traditional sock operations. Make people work harder, make people work slightly better, automate certain things. But ultimately, what they provide, what they deliver, is an improved model, and not really a revolutionary model. Why do we need to change the SOC, change our DNR operations dramatically? Or the main motivation is that at this point that most organizations, SOC scales linearly with the threats and with business assets. While many people lose sleep over threat actors doing bad things, personally, I lose sleep over businesses moving quickly, businesses expanding, businesses changing, assets changing. To me, if I'm tasked with monitoring for issues or detecting threats, I want to know where I'm detecting it. What's the lay of the land? Do I have a good surface area? Do I have the good asset layout? Many of the traditional approaches don't produce a good answer for this, or you lose assets, so you have proverbial servers in the closet or they're Cloud accordance. What is the way to do it better? What is the way to do it in a way that worked for others? Of course, we at Google are often asked, tell us how you did it. We are unusual in many dimensions, and simply copying our approach would not work. But when we created autonomic security operations, it was very much inspired by Google lessons, inspired by what we've done, but it's not a carbon copy of what we do because of the mismatch in our realities versus most client realities. What is the magic of autonomic security operations, our modern approach to SecOps? There are many areas of change, and there are many areas of transformation that we guide people throughout this course. But to me, the relentless drive to automation, rapid feedback loops and engineering mentality, a power in the ASO to achieve the results our clients are achieving and that we have achieved. Let's take this apart a little bit. First is sort of obvious, automation. This means, sure, I want to automate things in my stock. But ultimately, how do I go beyond just buying a sore tool and hoping for the best or implementing a playbook or two? This is where the engineering mentality, and engineering led approach, and also relentless improvements come in. You're not just doing, Hey, this is a sore, this is a playbook. I'm going to run it, I'm going to relieve some pressure on my sock. This is fine. This works. That's a great first step. But ultimately what you need is a more relentless drive to drive toil out to push manual less productive work, which does not give sustainable value out of your sock. Now, you would think that all your sock does is click at alerts and makes other "unproductive things" because unproductive here doesn't mean they're bad. It means they don't make systems better as a result. Instead, what we suggest in our approach is to sort of infuse more engineering mentality into this so that people don't just click alerts and hope the detection content is right, but they do own more of the pipelines, or at least they work closely with people who produce the detection logic. This means a lot of traditional wisdom, Level 1, Level 2 starts to unravel, starts to disappear, and the engineers come in who actually build the detection logic, maintain the pipelines, and produce the results. That's why, in many cases, we sort of say that the O in SOC is becoming less important, just like SREs became engineers rather than glorified system admins or improved system admins. We are suggesting that the SOC analyst would be a DNR engineer, detecting response engineer. This is what's powering the magic of ASO, our approach to SecOps, because this is what happens when you start to relentlessly drive automation, push toil out, push manual work out. By the way, some people think, what's the end of it? Are we going to push humans out? To be honest, no. In most cases, the drive to automation means that uniquely human tasks drop into human lab. Of course, we use AI, of course we recommend that in the future clients would use I for certain tasks. But AI wouldn't transform your 1990s SOC modeled in a 1980s snack into a modern operation. You wouldn't achieve ASO by buying AI and connecting it to your tool. To me, the magic is really in the relentless drive to automation, engineering that mentality and moving away from the O in SOC, building the operation, building the team, building the capability that does things automatically on an ongoing basis, where automation is built, improved, and rapidly adjusted to conditions. I hope you've enjoyed the ASO course. It's really impressive, and you would make yourself better as a result.

### Video - [Current State of SecOps](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/1153/video/504265)

- [YouTube: Current State of SecOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnOV6MIOrU)

In this first topic, identifying the current state of your security operations is discussed. As we go through this exercise, we describe a fictitious organization and break down key parts of their organization design, their team structure, and their tooling to ensure that we can identify bottlenecks, missing feedback loops, limitations of tooling or processes, automation opportunities, and sources of toil. In order to understand the effectiveness of your security operations, it is crucial to assess your security organization structure. Let’s delve into some key aspects to evaluate. Is there a strong feedback loop between security, developers, and the business? Effective communication of security requirements to development teams is essential for building secure applications. Is there a well-established feedback loop that allows security teams to provide input and guidance during the development process? Collaboration and information sharing between security and development teams are vital to ensure security is integrated into the development lifecycle. Does the security architecture team have direct feedback from analysts and operational teams? The security architecture team plays a critical role in designing and maintaining the security infrastructure. How closely does the architecture team collaborate with security analysts and operational teams? Updating detection use cases based on operational results and involving analysts in tooling design fosters continuous improvement and ensures alignment with operational needs. Do you have a process to consume all inputs into the SIEM? The SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system serves as a central repository for security data. Is there a well-defined process in place to consume and ingest all relevant security data, including information from vulnerability management and compliance systems? Enriching security data with vulnerability and compliance information enhances the effectiveness of threat detection and response. How well does the security organization collaborate with other teams? Security is a cross-functional responsibility, requiring collaboration with various teams. Are there regular cross-functional meetings and forums for collaboration on security-related matters? Clear roles and responsibilities for addressing security issues promote effective collaboration and ensure that security is woven into the fabric of the organization. By assessing these aspects of your security organization structure, you can identify areas for improvement and implement measures to enhance collaboration, communication, and overall security effectiveness. This is an example of an organization that has a strong structure of security capabilities. Within their security operations team, they have an operations team, an automation team, a threat intelligence, and security education team. The architecture/engineering team that builds and deploys the tooling and log ingestion sits outside of the SOC. There are a few issues highlighted from this example which may be common across many organizations. The LOB development teams have no streamlined collaboration process with security, nor do they have a business security champion to collaborate with the security org. This leads to no feedback being shared to drive continuous improvement unless it’s an ad-hoc emergency incident. The architecture/engineering team does not enrich their data with context from their risk register, from their vulnerability management program. This data is very valuable and rich for security operations teams to understand when developing use cases, that way it can help prioritize certain assets over others. There is no feedback loop between the SOC and the architecture/engineering team, so, when false positives are identified in the field or logging issues occur, they don’t have a streamlined way of iterating and improving their detection infrastructure or their use cases. The structure of your security operations team plays a crucial role in determining its effectiveness. Let’s explore some key aspects to assess and improve your team structure. How is the security team organized and structured? Understand the organizational structure of your security team. Are there distinct teams or silos within the security organization? Assess whether these teams collaborate effectively or operate in isolation. How are the engineering and operational teams aligned? Assess how well the teams responsible for detection, response, automation, and threat intelligence work together. Is there a unified approach to tooling and processes for engineering use cases? Encourage collaboration and alignment between these teams to maximize the effectiveness of your security operations. How are you tracking and measuring your overall security program? Evaluate the metrics used to track and measure the effectiveness of your security program. Do these metrics effectively communicate the security program’s performance at different levels of seniority? Consider establishing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for key functions of your security program to set clear performance targets. How do teams track and manage their work and progress? Evaluate the tools and systems in place to track use case development, incidents, and feedback. Is there a centralized platform or knowledge-sharing system to facilitate effective communication and collaboration among team members? Establishing a robust tracking and management system enables teams to effectively monitor their progress and share knowledge. By assessing your security operations team structure, tracking and measurement practices, alignment between engineering and operational teams, and work management processes, you can identify areas for improvement and implement measures to enhance collaboration, communication, and overall effectiveness of your security operations. As we continue the example organization discussed earlier, let’s drill down on their operational team and find some more issues. We noticed that the automation team and the threat intelligence team both use JIRA, but neither of their queues prioritize working on the same use cases and they come up with their own objectives ad-hoc. This is cascaded by the fact that the threat intelligence team has no structured way of sharing knowledge to help prioritize use cases for detection engineering, and the automation team does not build detections per use case, but rather, as they see fit. This model should be designed to integrate and flow better, to eliminate the siloes, and to enable efficiency and efficacy. In order to ensure effective deployment and of detection use cases and automation, it is important to have a well-defined deployment process. Let’s explore some key aspects of your deployment process and evaluate its effectiveness. Question 1: How do you qualify the creation of a detection use case? To ensure the relevance and accuracy of your detection use cases, consider the following: Is the creation of a use case based on current threat intelligence? Do you leverage insights from incidents and post-mortems to guide use case development? Are frameworks like ATT&CK utilized to inform and validate the creation of use cases? Question 2: How do you add new use cases to your detection library? To continuously enhance your detection capabilities, consider the following: Do you follow a structured development process when adding new use cases to your detection library? Are you exploring and maximizing different types of analytics to cover a wide range of threats? Question 3: How do you track and remediate bugs, defects, and false positives in your alerts? To maintain the effectiveness of your detection capabilities, consider the following: Do you have a mechanism to capture and address bugs, defects, and instances of false positives within your use case library? Do you have defined service level objectives (SLOs) for remediation, ensuring timely resolution and continuous improvement? By evaluating and optimizing your deployment process, you can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of your security operations. Consider these key questions to identify areas for improvement and ensure a streamlined deployment of detection use cases and automation. Question 4: How do you develop automation? Effective automation can significantly enhance your security operations. Consider the following aspects of your automation development: Do you require an automation playbook for every detection use case to facilitate efficient response? Do you have dedicated engineers to build bespoke process automation tailored to your use cases? What percentage of your use cases have associated automation, maximizing efficiency and effectiveness? Question 5: Do you run integration tests for rules and automations? To ensure the reliability and accuracy of your rules and automations, consider the following: Do you conduct integration tests to validate the performance of rules and automations? Is your testing process automated or manual? Do you have a robust testing strategy that covers every detection you build?

- [YouTube: Information Requirements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgclj5PDgFk)

In the "Visibility" phase of the Autonomic Security Operations (ASO) journey, it is essential to gather critical information to establish a strong foundation for effective security operations. Here are the key questions and critical information requirements (CIRs) for each phase objective. Data Discovery: What data assets are considered critical by the organization? Instrumentation: What toolsets are being used to collect and analyze data? What are the ingestion sources for the collected data? Continuous Ingestion: What ingestion architecture should be used for the specified data sources? Pipeline Deployment: What are the requirements for executing the chosen ingestion architecture? Are there any shortcomings or limitations in the current pipeline deployment process? Use Case Development: Based on the available data sources, which ones are the most materially relevant for security purposes? What use cases should be deployed to maximize security effectiveness? By addressing these critical information requirements (CIRs), organizations can enhance their data visibility, optimize their data collection and analysis processes, and ensure that the right use cases are developed and deployed. Security Analytics is a crucial aspect of CD/CR, enabling effective threat detection and response. Here are the key objectives and critical information requirements (CIRs) for Security Analytics. The objective in log retention is to establish log retention policies, duration, and compliance measures. The enrichment objective is to identify and utilize enrichment sources for contextual information. The data aggregation objective is to collect and consolidate relevant data for comprehensive analysis. Threat detection is to develop and update detection rules to identify emerging threats. And finally in threat investigation, the objective is to define investigation processes and prioritize threat analysis. By addressing these objectives and fulfilling the CIRs, organizations can enhance their security analytics capabilities, improve threat detection, and streamline incident response processes. CD/CR functions play a vital role in achieving effective security operations. Here are the objectives and critical information requirements (CIRs) for each function: The alert triage objective is to define alert triage criteria, establish categories, determine roles and responsibilities, and define escalation procedures. The objective for case management is to define case taxonomy, determine case workflow, establish case prioritization, and integrate workflow into collaboration tools. The playbook development objective is to determine use case prioritization, establish playbook development process, specify content and structure, and define testing and maintenance steps. The incident management and response objective is to classify and prioritize incidents, define response roles and responsibilities, develop incident response playbooks, and ensure effective reporting and analysis. And finally, the objective of forensics collection is to create a methodology for forensics collection, determine data sources, establish retention and storage procedures, implement analysis tools, and define documentation and reporting practices. Continuous feedback plays a pivotal role in driving continuous improvement in security operations. Here are key actions to ensure effective continuous feedback. Dashboards, Metrics, Reports, OKRs Establish comprehensive security dashboards, generate actionable metrics and reports, and align security objectives with organizational OKRs. Use Case, Playbook, and Enrichment Refine and optimize use cases and playbooks, enhance enrichment techniques for context-rich analysis, and evaluate. Threat Research and Intelligence Stay updated with the latest threat research, integrate threat intelligence for better detection and response, and proactively identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Blameless Postmortems Conduct blameless postmortems for incident analysis, identify improvement areas in incident response, and learn from incidents to enhance incident handling. Shifting Left Promote early adoption of security practices, integrate security requirements in development processes, and embed security awareness throughout the organization. By implementing these actions, organizations can establish a culture of continuous improvement and drive the maturation of their security operations. Remember, the journey towards Autonomic Security Operations is an ongoing process, and continuous feedback serves as a critical enabler for enhancing security effectiveness and resilience.

- [YouTube: Steps Forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjfbBTahxrw)

For our final topic, we discuss some final steps to get you started on your journey. To initiate this journey successfully, organizations can follow these four essential steps, which lay the foundation for a comprehensive ASO implementation. Assess Current State The first step is to conduct a thorough assessment of the organization’s current security operations. This assessment should include an evaluation using the ASO Discovery Tool as well as any other methods (e.g., surveying, gathering data, or dashboards) of existing processes, technologies, and the skill sets of security personnel. Identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, along with any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the current security operations workflow. This assessment serves as a baseline to measure progress throughout the ASO transformation journey. Define the Vision and Objectives Once the current state assessment is complete, define a clear vision and set specific objectives for the ASO transformation. The vision should articulate the desired future state of security operations, aligned with the organization’s strategic goals. Objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) and reflect the desired outcomes of the ASO journey. This step provides a guiding framework for subsequent actions and helps align stakeholders around a common purpose. Develop a Roadmap Creating a roadmap is critical to ensure a structured and phased approach to the ASO transformation. Based on the defined vision and objectives, develop a roadmap that outlines the sequence of activities, milestones, and timelines for implementing ASO initiatives. Break down the transformation into manageable phases, with each phase addressing specific aspects such as process improvement, technology implementation, and talent development. The roadmap serves as a blueprint for the journey, ensuring a clear path forward and providing a means to measure progress. Secure Stakeholder Buy-In and Support Stakeholder buy-in and support are crucial for the success of the ASO transformation. Engage key stakeholders, including executive leadership, IT teams, security personnel, and other relevant departments, to secure their commitment and involvement. Communicate the benefits of ASO, such as enhanced security posture, operational efficiency, and risk reduction, in a way that aligns with their respective interests and responsibilities. Actively involve stakeholders in the decision-making process, seek their input, and address any concerns or resistance. Building a coalition of support will foster collaboration and ensure a collective effort towards the ASO transformation. By following these four steps—assessing the current state, defining the vision and objectives, developing a roadmap, and securing stakeholder buy-in and support—organizations can lay a strong foundation for their ASO transformation journey. This strategic approach sets the stage for a successful and sustainable implementation of Autonomic Security Operations, driving improved security outcomes, operational efficiency, and proactive threat management. Embark on this journey with conviction, and embrace the possibilities that ASO brings to revolutionize your security operations. Assess: Begin by assessing your current security operations and identifying areas for improvement. Understand your strengths, weaknesses, and critical needs to lay the foundation for your ASO journey. Define: Clearly define your objectives, goals, and desired outcomes for implementing ASO. Set a clear vision and roadmap that aligns with your organization's security strategy. Develop: Invest in the development of your teams and processes to enable ASO. Provide training, resources, and opportunities for your employees to enhance their skills and embrace the principles of ASO. Secure: Ensure that security is embedded throughout your organization's culture and processes. Implement security best practices, leverage cutting-edge technologies, and continuously assess and improve your security posture. Execute: Execute on your ASO journey with determination and persistence. Continuously measure your progress, adapt as needed, and celebrate achievements along the way. Remember to encourage your teams at all levels to contribute to the future of ASO. Encourage knowledge sharing, blog posts, participation in open-source projects, and continuous learning to foster a culture of innovation. (Google has an open source community project called Community Security Analytics, this may be a great starting point) When hiring new talent, consider including an understanding of ASO in the job requirements to attract individuals who are aligned with the principles and objectives of ASO. Lastly, leverage the expertise and support of industry leaders such as Google and Mandiant, along with their extensive partner ecosystem. Collaborate with them to bootstrap your ASO journey and benefit from their knowledge, experience, and resources. Ultimately, the journey towards autonomic security is focused on helping security practitioners focus on the core purpose of their profession – defend organizations against the bad actors – solve security threats, not close alerts for a living. To cultivate an industry focused on solving for tomorrow’s growing complexity, we need to encourage and inspire all security professionals to pursue the path of ASO.

Yes, I'm back and guess what? I'm still in the same black T-shirt. I haven't moved a single position because I'm not recording this week by week. I'm recording this all at once. But I'm really thrilled that you made it this far because in my time, this might have taken an hour for me to record and in your time, you've probably spent hours, days or weeks getting through all this course content. Well, first off, kudos to getting through the first several, four weeks of the course. Now, you probably spent Week 5, basically getting into the ASO assessment tool, which is a tool that we created, and again, is going to be a tool that we're going to rapidly iterate in. It might not even be called ASO assessment tool by the time it comes out. It might be the security operations discovery platform, or whatever we end up branding it to by the time this whole course is launched. But this platform basically can help you identify some serious structural flaws or even start to think about the way that everything is run in your organization and gather some really rich data that you can go and present to your teams, go and present to your managers, go and present to your directors, as a way to help influence a couple of things. One, it can help influence team structures. Two, it can help influence engineering priorities, road map, strategic plans for years, specific projects. For example, if automation is something that your organization is really, really, struggling against, and you're not getting the support from your management team with the right tooling infrastructure around automation. This is again, one of those things where you've got the concrete data to go and highlight some of those gaps that you can start to think about how you all can make the right investments in people, process, and tech. I hope this assessment was valuable for you. You actually made it through pretty much the full course. Next week, we're going to get into a bit of a summary, and then we're going to close out. Congratulations and off to next week. Take care.

Congratulations on officially completing the Autonomic Security Operations course. In this final module, we review your learnings and provide you with additional resources to continue your learning journey. Over the last several modules, we covered theoretical, fundamental, and practical knowledge for transforming your work. We first dove into the emerging challenges that require cybersecurity practitioners to be more diligent now, more than ever, to maintain the equilibrium in our digital lives. We then examined all of the principles that underpin ASO as more than a framework, but a way of solving security challenges with the future in mind. We also explored what building a continuous detection, continuous response pipeline entails and some practical strategies on aligning your people, process, and technologies to CD/CR. And lastly, we went through the ASO discovery tool to benchmark your organization against the ASO maturity model and come out with insights on driving improvement. As we wrap up this course, it’s important to remember one of the valuable elements of automation – finding the right partners who share your vision. Between ASO, CD/CR, and the actual day-to-day job of security practitioners is a mountain of nuance and complex engineering to drive incremental changes that can lead to exponential outcomes. To reduce the burden on your workforce, you will want to consider investing in the right tools and the right partners who are innovating in ways that can realize your future towards ASO more rapidly. At RSA 2023, Google introduced the Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, an industry-first extensible platform powered by a specialized, security LLM, Sec-PaLM. This new security model is fine-tuned for security use cases, incorporating Google’s security intelligence such as Google’s visibility into the threat landscape and Mandiant’s frontline intelligence on vulnerabilities, malware, threat indicators, and behavioral threat actor profiles. Google Cloud Security AI Workbench powers new offerings that can now uniquely address three top security challenges: threat overload, toilsome tools, and the talent gap. It also features partner plug-in integrations to bring threat intelligence, workflow, and other critical security functionality to customers.

Hey, you made it, congratulations. I hope you got something that you're able to take out of this course. You're able to go apply it, your work and your personal skills in your personal projects, whatever it is. I hope that this was something valuable, a mindset that you've gained that you're able to go and take and use and maximize the return in your lives. Whether that's through building additional technical skills, whether that's creating products or innovating or contributing to projects, or whether that's just being able to provide better for your families. All these things are all so important and we have such a short amount of time in our careers, if you think about it. So the mindset that we approach in our jobs is actually, in fact, the most important skill of them all. So you went through the course and you realize that with all of the complexities we have to face, it's near impossible to keep following this old reactive legacy approach to security operations. If you're able to really take this CDCR, this continuous detection, continuous response mindset, whatever you end up calling it at the end of the day. But if you can take this mindset and use that as an approach to mend all of the different process, the teams, the things that you need to do. And truly understanding the life cycle of your work, then you're probably going to have some really remarkable impact. So one thing I want to share is as you wrap up and get back to your lives and your jobs and work on the next exciting project. I want you to truly think about the industries that are going to be impacted by AI in the next several years. And if you don't know which industries they are, the answer is all of them. [LAUGH] Every job, every industry, every task, everything is going to be impacted by AI. I mean, we've spent the past 30, 60 years trying to figure out how to talk to computers, and now we've given computers a voice to speak like us. And so you can imagine that if we've had this much innovation in 30, 60 years of technology in IT, then wow, the next 30 years are going to be remarkable, which is really exciting. But also equally as important for security practitioners to take into account that we are the ones that have to literally understand the use and abuse cases of all of the applications and the organizations that we protect. And therefore, it's our responsibility to be very vocal, to be very assertive in ways, to be very collaborative, to speak up. And to play a role in defining, designing, protecting, and ensuring the safety and security of the world. Some of you might work on tools like TikTok and social media networks that kids use and parents use and people from all different backgrounds use. Some of you may work on providing a new way to cast ballots at the election. And how critical is that, right? Some of you may work on energy and critical infrastructure. Some of you may be in the military, right? So every single industry has some type of an impact, a security impact, that can impact the well-being of others individually and of the communities. And so really, really embrace this role that you have in society, because this role isn't just about building the latest detections to alert on MITRE's top TTPs over the next couple of years. It's actually to really understand and embrace the roles you play in your businesses and in your organizations. I mean, if all else fails, always put yourself in the mindset of the founder of the business. And pretend that you were going to go and start this giant e-commerce platform that is going to be used by people all over the world. And you're the founder and you're building and scaling and running this operation. And eventually, they need to hire this dedicated security team, and they need to be so close to the threats that the business faces, because the threats can impact so many people, right? So whenever you're in your jobs, no matter what you do, whether you're in banking, whether you're in gaming, always put yourself in the position of the founder. And try to imagine that had you founded this business, how would you like to define and design process to align, to allow you to execute on the objectives and the goals that you set out for your shareholders, your stakeholders, whoever they may be? And don't forget, AI is going to be as synonymous as the Internet. So in some way, shape, or form, security practitioners need to, at a minimum, understand all of the different facets of modern AI technologies, like large language models, image models. What type of implications these are going to have and how we can use these to our advantage, and also potentially, how our adversaries can also use these same things. I mean, the same way that AI is going to allow us to do analytical capabilities at an exponential scale that we've never been able to do before, the same tools can be used on the opposing end. So this is really important. Take those skills, harness them in your organizations, find some interesting side projects in a space that's really fascinating to you. It's the culmination and the combination of all of your efforts that are going to have a remarkable impact in this industry. And don't forget that every year, there's a bunch of kids that graduate from school or drop out of school that are interested in getting into the space. And the only way they're going to get into the space is if we set the path for them. If we make it exciting, we open up the pathways and we help everyone grow in the space together. Let's go knock out those, what, 1.4 million job openings in cybersecurity together, right? [LAUGH] Anyways, feel free to connect on social. Find us on LinkedIn, Twitter, you can reach out and we're all really excited to engage with the community here. And don't forget, do that ASO assessment tool if you can. That way, you can start to benchmark some of your skills as an organization. And you can take that data and maybe use it as some insight to help you go and drive change in your organizations. All righty, take care, everyone. Bye bye.
