Hello and welcome to the course. In this course, we introduce you to Google Chat, Google’s chat software included with Google Workspace. You learn how to use Google Chat for simple one-to-one and small group conversations, and how spaces in Google Chat are used to better collaborate with others. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities, you gain confidence in using Google Chat. We encourage you to stay signed in to Google Workspace during the entire course, not just for the activities. Pause a video lecture or demonstration at any time, and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic that is being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer “On the Rise Bakery” as they embark on their Google Workspace journey. At the end of the course, you use Google Chat to solve a particular business challenge being faced by On the Rise. So let’s discuss the scenario we are using as you learn about a few important features of Google Chat. Over the last three decades, On the Rise has primarily focused on sales in its physical locations. As the company expanded globally, its partner-owners Thomas Omar and Seroja Malone have sought to expand online ordering, same-day delivery, and overnight shipping options. Thomas and Seroja have asked Anthony Dylan, who is in charge of product distribution and operations for On the Rise, to lead this new initiative. Anthony asks you for your help. He wants to communicate with members of his new project team by using a shared chat and and collaborate on files, all in one place. He also wants team members to be able to assign tasks to each other. Are you ready to learn about Google Chat and help the On the Rise team solve their business challenge? Let’s begin.

Welcome to Module 1: Introduction to Google Chat This course familiarizes you with how Google Chat can support your organization’s ability to communicate using instant messaging. As we move through the material, you acquire the skills you need to help On the Rise solve their organizational problems. By assisting them, you learn how to apply these skills at your own organization. So what are these tools and how can they enhance collaboration and workflow efficiency at your organization? From direct messages to group conversations, Google Chat helps teams communicate and collaborate efficiently. With dedicated, virtual chat rooms called spaces, and threaded conversations, Google Chat lets users track the status of their projects and follow up on tasks. Google Chat also makes it easy for teams to get their work done by using a single platform to share and collaborate on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files.

## Messaging in Google Chat

In module 2, you'll learn about messaging individuals and groups in Google Chat. You'll also discover customization options, collaboration features and how Google Chat integrates with other Google Workspace products.

### Video - [Messaging in Google Chat](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427298)

* [YouTube: Messaging in Google Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3WJnqUcFMM)

Welcome to Module 2: Messaging in Google Chat With Google Chat, you can use direct messaging to have a private conversation with a colleague or a small group of people. In this module, you’ll explore how Google Chat’s unique features can enhance your organization's ability to communicate and collaborate. You’ll learn more about sending individual and group messages, managing your Google Chat settings, and customizing and editing messages. You’ll also learn how to create and join video meetings and audio calls from one-on-one chats.

### Video - [Send a message](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427299)

* [YouTube: Send a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nOzhhJiaRc)

If you haven’t already opened Google Chat, do so now by visiting chat.google.com Now that you’ve opened Google Chat on the web, how do you send a message? To send a message directly to a person, click their name in the Chat list. If the name isn’t already in the Chat section, click Start a chat and enter the name or email address of a colleague. Suggestions might appear as you enter text. If you’re using Gmail, click New chat. You can also click the Find people, spaces, and messages search bar and type a name or email address. To send a one-on-one message to someone outside of your organization, simply enter their email address. After you click the person who you want to message, type your message, and press Enter on your keyboard, or click the Send message icon on your screen. It’s that simple! To save you time, Google Chat might suggest possible phrases to respond to a message. You can click a Smart reply to insert it into your message, or create your own reply. But what if you want to send a message to a group? Let’s look at that next.

### Video - [Use group conversations](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427300)

* [YouTube: Use group conversations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOJActyEXLA)

In this video, you explore how to use a group chat in Google Chat. You’ll learn how to: Create a group. Send a direct message to a group. Edit and react to a sent group message. First, let’s create a group. Having a conversation with several people at the same time can be useful. To start a new conversation, open Google Chat and click Start a chat or click New chat in Gmail, and then click Start group conversation. Type the names or email addresses of the people you want to message and click their names to add them to the group conversation. Suggestions might appear as you enter text. You can also select people from the list of suggested contacts by clicking the person’s name. Click Start DM with selected users when you finish adding all members to the group. Now, we can send a direct message to a Group. Type your message and click Send Message, just like you would in a one-on-one chat. Remember, messages aren’t limited to text. To communicate with an individual in the group directly, you can use an @mention, which is also known as tagging. Type the @ symbol in front of the person’s name and select their name in the drop-down list. The other person will see a red dot if they are @mentioned, and they might also receive a notification for that message depending on their settings. You can also send a link to a website by typing the URL or pasting the web address. A link preview showing the thumbnail of the webpage might appear in the chat. While you’re composing or editing the message, you can click the x to remove the preview, if desired. Click Formatting options to bold, italicize, or underline text to add emphasis. You can also change the text color, use bulleted lists or strikethrough formatting. Third, let’s edit and react to messages sent in the group conversation. After a message is sent, you can edit it to add or remove text, files, or Google Meet video conferencing details. To edit a message that you sent, hover your mouse over the message to expose the options and click Edit. Of course, this wouldn’t be modern communication without an emoji. Click Add emoji to open the panel. You can search, click the emoji category, or scroll to find the emoji you want. Then, click the desired emoji to insert it into the message. When you have made your changes, click Update to complete your message edit. To delete a message that you sent, hover your mouse over the message and click More actions. Notice that you can mark as unread, forward to inbox, add to tasks, or delete. We explain these more in a later lesson in this module. Choose Delete from the list and then click Delete in the dialog to confirm the action and permanently remove the message.

* [YouTube: Activity 1 explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAM2GqVmWp0)

Now it’s your turn. In the following activity, you’ll create a group chat.

### Document - [Activity 1: Create a group chat](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/documents/427302)

### Video - [Set a status in Google Chat](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427303)

* [YouTube: Set a status in Google Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FpXI2zV7c)

You can set your status in Google Chat to let others know when you’re available. Google Chat can automatically set your status based on your activity. The green circular icon indicates you’re active. This means that Gmail or Google Chat is open. If you've been inactive in Gmail or Google Chat for the last 5 minutes, your status changes to Idle, which is represented by an orange clock icon. If you’ve been idle for more than 10 minutes or you’re no longer connected to the internet, your status changes to Away. The icon for away is a white circle, and you can manually set yourself as Away. Let’s say you’re in an important meeting or busy working on a new task and you don’t want to be interrupted. If you’re online, but want to mute your chat notifications, you can change your status to Do not disturb for the duration of your choosing. You can choose a specific time duration as short as 30 minutes or as long as 24 hours. Alternatively, you can choose the Until a specific time option to set an exact time and date. If there’s a specific time when you regularly want to mute your notifications, for example from 2-3 PM every Wednesday, you can click to Set a do not disturb schedule in Google Chat. To add a new schedule, click Create new, enter the details of the times and days that you want to pause notifications, and then click Save. You’re not limited to just one time: you can create as many do not disturb schedules as you need. Aside from using Automatic, Away or Do not disturb, you can add a custom status. Select a pre-existing option like Be right back or Commuting, or choose an emoji and write your own. Google Chat also updates your status according to your events in Calendar. Your Google Chat status automatically updates to out of office, in a meeting, or in focus time based on your calendar status. You can always override your automatic calendar status with a custom one. To see the status of another user, find their name in the list of chats and you can see their status next to their name. As with your own status, users can appear active, away, idle, or on do not disturb. If they do not appear in the list of chats, click the Find people, spaces, and messages search bar and type the name or email address of a colleague. Click the name of the person you want to message. To see how long their status will be on Do not disturb, open your conversation with them and the remaining time will appear by their name. You can still send messages to the person, but they might not see your message immediately.

### Video - [Manage your conversations](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427304)

* [YouTube: Manage your conversations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pYOKU2PtBU)

After you start a conversation, hover over a person’s name to see more options to manage the conversation. If you view a message that you want to reply to later, you can mark the message as unread. You can also mark a message as read, even if you haven’t viewed it. You can click Pin to keep the conversation at the top of the list of chats, which lets you return to the conversation easily. By default, you are notified about any new messages in your chat conversations. However, notifications can be turned off for a conversation. To change your notifications for new messages in a one-on-one or group conversation, hover your mouse over the conversation name in the panel to reveal the options button. Click the options button, and then choose Turn off notifications. To resume notifications, hover your mouse over the conversation name in the panel to reveal the options button. Click the options button, and then choose Turn on notifications. We talk more about configuring your notification settings in the lesson on managing your Google Chat settings later in this module. You can also block a person from sending you messages. In a conversation, click the person’s name at the top of the chat window and select Block. When you block someone in Google Chat, they can still see the past messages in your conversation, but they won’t be able to message you. Neither person will be able to edit the messages you’ve exchanged previously in Google Chat. Remember that links or files you shared with the person before blocking them are still active. Also, the conversation and their name will disappear from the Chat section, but you can choose to unblock them from the Google Chat settings menu. Sometimes conversations become dormant and it would be beneficial to remove them from view. To hide a direct conversation, click the more options button and then select Hide conversation. To hide a group conversation, click the more options button, click Leave, and then click Leave again in the modal window. The conversation will no longer appear in the list of chats. If you begin a conversation with that person or group later, the chat history will reappear. Hiding the conversation only affects your chat view, not the other participants’ views. If you want to remove the chat history of a conversation, you can click the more button, and then choose Delete conversation. Once again, this will only delete the conversation for you, but the conversation history is still available to the other person. If it is a group conversation, you can’t delete the history. Sometimes you might want messages in the conversation to be visible only temporarily; for example, if they relate to a confidential matter or secretive project. To turn off a conversation’s message history, click the conversation, then click the conversation name, and click Turn off history. Messages will be deleted after 24 hours. However, be aware that your organization controls your Google Chat message history. As a result, you might not have the option to disable it, and messages might be retained for legal discovery purposes.

### Video - [Message requests](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427305)

* [YouTube: Message requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDopu0dO32Q)

Imagine you have a quick question for a client and you want to send her an instant message. You know she uses Google Chat, but she doesn’t work at your company. With Google Chat, you can connect to external users by typing their email address into the search. Any person you message in Google Chat who is not a member of your organization will have “External” next to their name in the chat window. Similarly, people outside of your organization might be able to send you a chat message. You receive a message request the first time that someone sends you a direct message. To view message requests, open Google Chat and click the Start a chat and then click Message requests. You might also see that message requests appear in your list of chat messages with an envelope icon, instead of the user’s Google Account profile photo. Click Message requests to view the list of outstanding message requests. You can view the message by clicking the name of the sender. Google Chat filters messages requests that appear to be spam into a separate section. You can click Spam to review them. When the message request is open, you can accept or ignore it. If you accept a message, the requester can view your basic profile details such as your name, Google profile photo, and email address. They can also see when you're online. If you ignore a message request, the message goes away, and you can also block the requester. The requester can't tell you ignored them, but if you need to find the request again, you can search for the person in Google Chat by using their email address.

If you’re using Google Chat within Gmail, you still need to open Google Chat for web or the standalone app to access settings. Clicking the settings button in Gmail will only provide you with options to change your email experience. When you open Google Chat on a desktop, you might be prompted to snooze mobile notifications whenever you’re active on your computer. If you’re using Google Chat on an Android or iOS device, you can manage mobile notifications from the mobile app. In Google Chat settings, you can manage your desktop notifications. To see your options and make changes, click Settings in the toolbar. In the Desktop notifications section, check the box to Allow chat notifications. To adjust notification sounds, select your desired melody from the drop-down list. If you don’t want a notification sound, choose None from the list.

To configure the Chrome browser to show Google Chat notifications, click Customize and control Google Chrome, and then click Settings. In the panel, click Privacy and security, and then click Site settings. From the Permissions list that appears, select Notifications Depending on the size of your screen, you might need to scroll to see it.

Repeat the process again to add Gmail by using https://mail.google.com:443 as the URL. Aside from desktop notifications that are managed in your browser, you can manage the remaining settings directly from Google Chat. Email notifications in Google Chat let you receive an email when you don’t read a direct message or a message you’re tagged in. To enable this feature, select Only @mentions & direct messages from the drop-down list. This feature can be helpful if you have chats where the conversation history is disabled, because it can help prevent the contents of a message from disappearing if you didn’t view it within 24 hours. If you’d prefer not to receive email notifications, select Off from the drop-down list. Within settings, you can view the accounts and spaces that you blocked and unblock them. You can also choose whether to enable Smart Reply, which provides suggestions to help you quickly reply to messages. Check the box to show suggested replies when available on web and desktop. Lastly, to save your device's battery—or as a personal aesthetic preference—you can use the dark theme in Google Chat. Within the Appearance section of your Google Chat settings, select the radio button corresponding to Dark to activate dark mode. Within the Appearance section of your Google Chat settings, select the radio button corresponding to Dark to activate dark mode.

* [YouTube: Collaborate in Google Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex0-g0BXQHI)

Google Chat has many interactive features that help you to collaborate better with others. As you communicate with someone or a team, you might want to retain important messages for future reference. Google Chat lets you forward messages directly to Gmail. To do this, hover your mouse over a message, click More actions, and then click the Forward to inbox. The message you clicked and the previous four messages in the conversation thread will be sent to your inbox. If the messages are ever deleted from Google Chat or you turn off history for the conversation, the messages will remain in Gmail. To create a task in your personal task list, you can hover your mouse over a message, click More actions, and click Add to tasks. Creating, editing, and sharing files is an important part of collaboration in the modern office. Google Chat makes it simple to share files with a person or group through messages. Click the Upload file button to browse your computer for a file to share. You can add a message along with the file for context or requests before sending the message. A thumbnail image of the file will appear in the conversation, and your colleagues can click to open and view it or download it. To share a file from Drive, click Google Workspace tools and then click Drive file. If anyone in the conversation doesn’t have permission to access it, Google Chat will prompt you to modify the access to let them view, edit, or comment on the file. You can view Docs and Sheets files shared with Drive directly in Google Chat. When collaborating on Docs and Sheets files directly in Google Chat, you can edit, format, share, and rename them. To open the editor, hover your mouse over the file and click Open in chat. If you need to use additional features like commenting, you can click and open the file in a new tab to do so. Messaging can be an efficient way to communicate, but sometimes a face-to-face meeting is necessary. Click Add video meeting to invite a person or group to join a Google Meet video meeting. To schedule a meeting for later with the person or all members of the group that you’re messaging, click the Google Workspace tools, select Calendar invite, and add the meeting details using the Google Calendar side panel on your screen.

Open a one-on-one chat message in the app, and click the Start voice call or Start video call icon. To end the call, click the Leave call icon. Using emojis and GIFs can also help you better express yourself during virtual conversations. You already learned how to insert an emoji into a message. You can also use an emoji to react to a message sent in any direct or group message sent in Google Chat, even shared files. To choose the appropriate emoji, hover your mouse over the message, click Add reaction, and don’t forget to have fun! You can also make your own emojis and share them across your organization. Custom emojis can help you personalize messages and celebrate your team’s culture. To create a custom emoji, click Add emoji, and then click Create. Select Upload image to choose a picture from your device. Name your emoji, and then click Save. You can find custom emojis like other emojis by using the Search bar.

* [YouTube: Spaces in Google Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XE_FXB7BlM)

Welcome to Module 3: Spaces in Google Chat Google Chat lets you create spaces to contain persistent conversations, with multiple threads, the ability to add or remove participants and to share files and tasks with a group. In this module, you’ll learn about the different uses of spaces, and compare them with individual and group chats. You’ll learn how to create, manage, search, and join a space. You also explore how to use spaces to better collaborate on projects.

### Video - [Uses for spaces](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427310)

* [YouTube: Uses for spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--JKWSLWyXk)

In the previous module, you learned how to send direct messages to a person or small group for impromptu conversations. For persistent conversations, such as those related to a specific project or the ongoing activities of a team, spaces are a useful way to stay connected. Spaces can provide a dedicated place for knowledge sharing and community building for teams of all sizes. They can help new employees with onboarding and act as a historical record of activities around a specific topic or an event. Spaces can also help people connect based on shared interests. If a space is discoverable, anyone in your organization can search and join the space. In spaces, features like in-line topic threading and conversation summaries make conversations more organized and searchable. File sharing and task assignment also make it easy to reference information whenever it's needed and help people communicate more efficiently.

* [YouTube: Join a space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wSNQtWUis)

Earlier in this course, you learned how to create a space and add members. Sometimes you might want to find a space that someone has already created, so you can participate in the conversation or view collective knowledge on a topic. You can click the Spaces tab to view the list of spaces you’ve already joined. If you’d like to search for additional spaces available to you, you can use the search function. To search for a space when you’re using Google Chat within Gmail, type the name of the space into the search bar. You might see the space name appear as a suggested option. Otherwise press enter on your keyboard to complete your search, and click the Spaces tab that appears within the search results. Any spaces you’ve been invited to will be at the top of the list. You can click Preview or Join. When you’re previewing a space, you can read messages, but you can’t participate in the discussion and won’t get any notifications. If you choose to join a space, you can reply to messages, react and post new messages. You can also manage your notifications after joining a space. To change your notifications for new messages in a space, hover your mouse over the space name in the panel to reveal the options button. Click the options button, select Notifications, and then make a selection from the options in the modal window. If you choose All, you will be notified for each new message in the space and replies to the threads you follow. As a note, if you want to see new replies on a thread that you did not post or reply to, you can choose to follow the thread. To subscribe to a message chain, open the thread, and click Follow. To limit notifications for a space to only threads you follow and @mentions, you can choose Following in the modal window for notifications. Otherwise, choose Off if you would prefer to not receive any notifications in a space. If you select Off, @mentions will still appear via a red dot next to the space’s name, although you will not see a notification sound or banner on your screen. You can also access notification options by opening a space, clicking the space name, and choosing Notifications from the list. Be sure to click Save after making a change to your notification preferences. As a space member, you can add or remove people from the spaces you join. When you want to leave a space, find the space name in the list of spaces. Hover your mouse over the space name in the panel to reveal the options button. Click the options button, select Leave, and then click Leave space in the modal window. Alternatively, you can open the space, and then click the space name to access the same options. Later, if you want to rejoin the space, in the search bar, enter the name of the space, and rejoin. As you join spaces and chat with people inside and outside your organization, you can use the search function in Google Chat to find a message. The search will default to the conversation or space you’re viewing, but you can also switch to a search of all spaces and conversations. Narrow your search by person, by @mentions, or by file type. The search results will display the messages, and you can also go directly to the thread found by your search.

* [YouTube: In-line threading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnr35pDsbQ0)

In spaces, you can reply directly to messages by creating an in-line thread to continue the conversation on that topic. Threads let you discuss a topic that might not be of interest to everyone without disrupting the flow of a space. By default, replying in-line notifies the original poster and those who have either been @mentioned or replied in the thread. Users following the thread are also notified. To reply in-line, hover your mouse over a message, click Reply in thread, type your message, and click Send Message. Like a typical chat message, you can use emojis and GIFs, upload files, and add video meetings. You also have the Google Workspace tools menu, so you can add a Drive file or a Calendar invite.

* [YouTube: Collaborate in spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyQpRX6MHZk)

The collaborative features for spaces are similar to those offered in one-on-one and group conversations, but there are some key distinctions. In spaces, you can view send, and manage files. To view a list of the files shared in a space, click the Files tab. You can upload files, and depending on their type, you can preview or edit them. You can add files to Drive that were originally uploaded to the space. If the file has already been saved to Drive, you see the option to move the file within Drive. Unlike one-on-one and group messages, you can create and assign tasks that are viewable by everyone in the space. To create a task, navigate to the Tasks tab and click Add space task. You can also create a task from a message sent in the space. To do this, hover your mouse over a message in the space, click More actions, and then click Create space task. You can rename the task, assign it to someone, or add the date/time the task is due before clicking Add. In a direct message to another individual or a group, when you delete a message, it’s removed for all participants in the chat. In a space, the message is deleted, but an information notice that says Message deleted by its author appears.

* [YouTube: Space management options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWjg1HMdRO4)

When you create a space in Google Chat, you automatically become the Space Manager. Space Managers have a diamond next to their names in the member list and message stream. As a member of a space, you can add or remove members. As a Space Manager, you can also assign or remove other Space Managers. You can also delete messages within the message stream, even if you didn’t send them. If the need arises, space managers can also delete the entire space. Access to spaces can be restricted to only people and groups who have been added. When people are connecting based on shared interests in specific topics, it might be helpful to make a space discoverable. Discoverable spaces let anyone in your organization find, view, and join them. When spaces are discoverable, you can use a link to join these spaces and invite people to spaces you’re already in. To retrieve the shareable link for a space you’re a member of, click the space name, and then select Copy link to this space. Space managers can edit the space description. and manage access to the space. You’ll learn how to manage who can access a space in the next lesson.

To remove them as a Space Manager, Click the options next to the person’s name, and then select Change from Space Manager to member. Manage access to a space. After a space is created and the conversation evolves, Space Managers can update the space access from restricted to discoverable, or the other way around. To change the space access, open the space, click the group name and then click View members. In the space access section, select your desired audience option from the drop-down list. You can choose to make either a restricted space discoverable to your organization or a discoverable space restricted. To delete a space, open the space, and click the name to see the options. Select Delete, and then, in the dialog, click Delete again. Note: When you delete a space, all messages and space tasks in the space are also deleted.

Welcome to Module 4: Apps in Google Chat Connecting apps to Google Chat lets you integrate services, automate work, and save time on tasks. This module introduces you to apps in Google Chat. You learn how to find apps add them to spaces and conversations. You’ll also explore common actions that you can take with the apps that Google creates and manages.

### Video - [Using apps](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/516/video/427323)

* [YouTube: Using apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj4QNEg_n9c)

Apps in Google Chat can automate tasks by performing actions based on the messages you send to them. They can be programmed to do specific tasks, like retrieving information about available flights or scheduling meetings. They can quickly get information, which saves you time and effort, and you don’t need to start or stop them like a traditional software program. In Google Chat, you can directly message apps or add apps to spaces and conversations. When you interact with an app in Google Chat, it can see your email address, profile photo, and other basic information about you. When used in conversations with other participants, apps can also see the basic information of other people in the conversation. However, apps can't see the email addresses or profile photos of other conversation participants unless they interact with that app themselves.

In this video, you explore how to add apps to spaces. You’ll learn how to: Find apps and start one-on-one messages with them. Add an app to a conversation or space. Remove an app from a one-on-one message or a space. First, let’s find apps. Open Google Chat and click Start a chat or New chat in Gmail. Then, select Find apps. Type the name of the app into the search bar or scroll to browse the various apps. Note: If your workspace admin doesn’t let you use an app, you might still see it in the list of apps, but you won’t be able to install it. Next, let’s add an app to a conversation or space. After you identify the app you want to use, click Add on the app card. Select Chat to start a one-on-one conversation with the app or Add to space. You can also add an app to a one-on-one conversation or group chat. Open the conversation, click the conversation name, and then select Add apps (if it’s a one-on-one message) or Add people & apps (if it’s a group message). Enter the name of the app or search for the app, and then click Add. Now, let’s remove the app from the conversation or space. Let’s start by removing your one-on-one conversation with an app. Find the app in the chat panel. In the options, click Uninstall. To remove an app from a conversation, open the conversation, and then click the conversation name. Select View members from the list, and then click the Apps tab. Hover your mouse over the app you want to remove, to reveal more options, and then select Remove from chat.

There are several Chat apps available from Google that can help you and your team get updates on projects, see product notifications instantly, and search for information. For example, the Meet app for Google Chat is a meeting scheduling assistant. You can send messages to the app by using natural human language like “Schedule a meeting with Thomas on Wednesday.” The Meet app can automatically find times that work for everyone and let you choose what you like best. The Drive app for Google Chat lets you manage everything in one place. You can use this app to receive Drive notifications in Google Chat for events like when a new file or folder is shared with you. You can also see tasks assigned to you and new access requests for your files. Asana is a web-based project management tool. You can configure the Asana app for Google Chat in direct messages and spaces to see updates on your projects. You can also use the Giphy app in Chat to query GIFs and send them to conversations and spaces. Using this app gives you a different catalog of images than what the GIF button in your text box provides.

Now it’s time to implement everything that you learned. Before you get started, let’s review the business challenge. Over the last three decades, On the Rise has primarily focused on sales in its physical locations. As the company expanded globally, its partner-owners Thomas Omar and Seroja Malone have sought to expand online ordering, same-day delivery and overnight shipping options. Thomas and Seroja have asked Anthony Dylan, who is in charge of product distribution and operations for On the Rise, to lead this new initiative. Anthony asks you for your help. He wants to communicate with members of his new project team by using a shared chat and collaborate on files, all in one place. He also wants team members to be able to assign tasks to each other. In the following activity, you will help the On the Rise team solve their business challenge by using Google Chat.

Congratulations on completing the course! Let’s do a quick recap. You learned how to use Google Chat to have an impromptu conversation with a colleague or a small group of people. This is a great way to connect with others instantly. You explored some ways to effectively collaborate with others by using Google Chat, like how to upload and share files with others. You also learned how Google Chat integrates with other Google Workspace applications like Gmail and Docs. Google Chat also provides chat rooms, called spaces, that are better suited for long-term conversations, particularly with a group that changes or a large project team. You learned how to create and manage a space. You also learned how to add, search for, and follow threads in the space. Then you learned about using apps in Google Chat. Finally, you used the knowledge you gained from the course to help solve a particular business challenge that our fictional Google Workspace customer, On the Rise Bakery, faced. We hope that you enjoyed the course and are now confident about using Google Chat. As a cloud application, Google Workspace is adding new features all the time, so do continue to explore them as they are rolled out.
