Welcome to Preparing for Your Professional Cloud Architect Journey. In this course, you'll learn more about the skills covered on the Professional Cloud Architect certification exam. Modules 1 through 4 each point to one section of the exam guide. Module 5 covers sections 5 and 6 of the exam guide. In Module 6, you'll walk through the process of breaking down a case study and create a study plan. However, it's important to clarify that this course by itself will not prepare you to take the certification exam. This is not a "cram session." The exam is purposefully calibrated to test your ability to apply the knowledge required of a Professional Cloud Architect, not merely repeat it. Cram sessions have minimal impact on your ability to pass the exam. Instead, the goal of this course is to help you better structure your preparation time for the exam. You'll learn about the scope of each exam section, assess your current knowledge and skills through diagnostic questions, and review where to find additional tools and resources to include in your study plan. In this introductory module, you'll learn about the role of a Professional Cloud Architect, the types of resources available to support your study, and how you will use the workbook in this course to create your study plan.

Why become a Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect? Certification value has significantly increased. Becoming Google Cloud certified gives you industry recognition; it validates your technical expertise and can be the starting point to take your career to the next level. You might be curious about what differentiates a "professional" cloud certification from an "associate" level one. The professional level certification expects the exam taker to know how to evaluate case studies and design solutions to meet business requirements—in addition to knowing about technical requirements—for customer implementation.

As you explore the role of the Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct in this course, you'll also explore different sections of the exam guide, which forms the basis for the Professional Cloud Architect certification exam. In the following modules, diagnostic questions will help you assess your knowledge of each section of the exam guide. The exam guide for the Professional Cloud Architect Certification is divided into 6 sections that contain one or more objectives. We'll focus on where you can find resources at the section objective level. The exam guide is on the certification page of our online documentation. Note that there is a separation between the team that develops the Professional Cloud Architect exam questions and the team that develops the courses and exam preparation materials. The course developers and instructors do not know what questions will be on your Professional Cloud certification exam, and your exam might be different to everyone else's. The goal of this course is to determine what you know and what you don't know to help you prepare a study plan and be ready for the Professional Cloud certification exam. Later, when you take the exam, you will demonstrate whether you have the skills and knowledge required to earn the Professional Cloud Architect certification. Throughout this course, you'll be pointed to specific resources and documentation that can help you fill the gaps that you identify through the diagnostic questions. Let's go over the types of resources you might want to include in your study plan. Google provides resources to help you develop your skills and experience with Google Cloud solutions. The learning path for this certification includes in-person or online courses, online practice labs and skill badges, and practice questions. The courses recommended for the Professional Cloud Architect certification include: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure, Architecting with Google Compute Engine, Architecting with Google Cloud: Design and Process, Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine, and Logging, Monitoring and Observability in Google Cloud. You'll learn more about how these courses relate to the sections of the exam guide as you complete the modules in this course. You can take these as instructor-led courses, or as on-demand courses on Coursera, Pluralsight, or Google Cloud Skills Boost. Keep in mind that Architecting with Compute Engine, is available on-demand as a three-course series. You should take all three courses: Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation, Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services, and Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation for the equivalent content to a 3-day instructor-led course. Logging, Monitoring and Observability in Google Cloud is available on-demand as a two-course series. You should take both courses: Logging and Monitoring in Google Cloud, and, Observability in Google Cloud. Please note that the instructor-led course Architecting with Google Cloud: Design and Process is available in an on-demand format as Reliable Cloud Infrastructure: Design and Process. Skill badges provide hands-on experience working with Google Cloud. Skill badges are learning paths consisting of labs that gives you hands-on practice with Google Cloud services or solutions. Pass the challenge lab at the end of the skill badge, and you'll receive a shareable credential that recognizes your ability to solve real-world problems with your cloud knowledge. As we review the diagnostic questions in this course, you'll also get recommendations for skill badges to include in your study plan. During the certification exam, some questions may refer to a case study that describes a fictitious business and solution concept. These case studies are intended to provide additional context as you answer the questions. You can access the official case studies from the exam guide. Before you take the certification exam, review the case studies that may be used and familiarize yourself with the requirements described in each. You should design a solution for each of them and learn in detail about the resources you would use in each of their environments. This will help you answer the portion of the exam that relates directly to those case studies and ensure that you understand the services and options that you may find detailed questions about in the rest of the exam. The case studies follow a similar format. Each one includes a company overview, a description of the solution concept, information about the existing technical environment, lists that outline business and technical requirements, and an executive statement that highlights priorities and challenges. In Module 6, you'll walk through the process of analyzing a case study in detail. We'll use Dress4Win, a case study from a previous version of the exam, as an example case study to examine the process. The Dress4Win case study is in your workbook. Before you take the exam, we recommend that you follow a similar process to review each of the official case studies. Sample questions are another resource that you can use to prepare. The diagnostic questions in this course are designed to help you identify your knowledge gaps. On the certification page, Google provides a different set of sample questions that can help you familiarize yourself with the format of the exam questions. After you complete the question set, you will receive feedback describing the rationale for the correct answers. The sample questions provide a good opportunity to practice taking the type of scenario-based, application-level questions on the exam. The exam questions provide you with a scenario, explain the goal or what you are trying to achieve, and ask you what you would do in that situation. Google also supplies official public documentation for its products and services. This documentation is available at cloud.google.com/docs. In each of the following modules, you'll learn about specific documentation resources to help you study that section in preparation for the exam.

One of the primary goals for this course is to help you devise a study strategy that focuses on the areas you need to work on. Let's quickly explore how the course is set up. The course and the workbook focus on each section of the exam guide sequentially. To help you craft a study strategy, you'll take diagnostic questions as part of each module. Many of these questions relate to our Cymbal Direct scenario and ask you to apply concepts you will need to be familiar with as a Professional Cloud Architect. Remember that these diagnostic questions are meant to help you identify gaps in your knowledge, but they don't represent all possible topics on the exam. Remember that we don't expect you to answer all these questions correctly right now. This is meant to be a course that you take toward the beginning of your Professional Cloud Architect journey, and many of you might not be networking experts yet. After you individually answer the diagnostic questions in each module, you will review the questions and the correct answers to identify what you need to study and where you can find more information. As you review the questions, there are hints with bolded text about what is important in the question and how you might evaluate the responses. Remember these tips for multiple choice questions: Read the question stem carefully. Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Try to anticipate the correct answer before looking at the options. You should be able to come up with the correct answer just from reading the question stem. More than one answer might be possible on multiple choice questions. Take questions at face value. If certain details are omitted, they are unlikely to contribute to the selection of the best answer. Pay attention to qualifiers ("usually", "all", "never", "none") and key words ("the best", "the least", "except"). We'll review select questions related to each section objective. As we cover each objective, you'll learn more about where the key concepts appear in Google Cloud documentation, specific courses and modules, and/or specific skill badges. At the end of each section objective, you'll find a list of related resources. Mark or highlight the specific resources you need in your study plan. The final part of your workbook contains a template to help you identify weekly goals and study activities. We'll talk more about putting together weekly goals at the end of this course. Now that you know about the overall setup of this course and how to use the workbook, let's get started by exploring section 1 of the exam guide.

Welcome to Module 1: Designing and Planning a Cloud Solution Architecture. In this module, you'll explore the scope of tasks involved in designing and planning Cymbal Direct's architecture, which corresponds to the first section of the Professional Cloud Architect Exam Guide. We'll start by discussing Cymbal Direct's requirements and how you would approach designing a cloud infrastructure. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through 10 diagnostic questions. Then, we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

- [YouTube: Designing Cymbal Direct's cloud architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZD1u7dfRg)

Let's start by exploring the breadth of considerations involved in the design of a cloud architecture and the role of the Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct. As a Professional Cloud Architect, your role involves exploring the different aspects of Cymbal Direct's existing environment and defining the business and technical requirements for its cloud architecture. These requirements determine how you will design the compute, networking, and storage infrastructure for a solution, how you will plan to migrate the existing environment to the cloud, and what future improvements you will envision. Assessment is the process of understanding what the current environment looks like and what the requirements are. After you understand the environment and goals, create a plan to get there. Migrating typically means moving from on-premises to the cloud, but it could be moving to Google Cloud from another cloud. It could also be a bit more abstract and mean migrating from the current architecture, whatever that is, to a new one. After your migration, even if you got everything right, you'll often find areas that you can improve. You might even have changes you plan on doing to improve the environment before you migrate. You'll often want to reduce the number of variables and initially migrate infrastructure without modification (often referred to as a "lift and shift" approach). After ensuring that things are working correctly, you can advance to optimization. In our scenario, Cymbal Direct is having scaling issues in the existing environment. They have several projects that are still on-premises and want to migrate those to Google Cloud. Let's look at Cymbal Direct's environment and requirements. As a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct, you need to understand what the existing environment looks like. Each element of the existing environment or infrastructure needs to be either replicated or replaced with equivalent or better functionality in your cloud solution. Your choices will be based on the availability of a replacement in Google Cloud and the business and technical requirements of a particular migration. Cymbal Direct has three major projects: Delivery by drone, partner and product APIs, and a social media highlighting service. As part of your assessment, you'll talk to the people who manage the existing environment and learn about it. This is a simplified version: Cymba Direct's delivery by drone project has a website frontend, pilot, and truck management system, all of which run on Kubernetes. Positional data for drones and trucks is stored in a MongoDB cluster. Drones are connected to VMs through a stateful connection and stream video through Real-time Messaging Protocol (RMTP) to the pilots, as well as commands from the pilots to the drones. For the purchase and product APIs project, the APIs are built into monolithic apps that were not designed for partner integration. The APIs are running on Ubuntu Linux VMs. The social media highlighting app is currently a proof of concept. The application currently runs on a single SuSE Linux VM, uses MySQL and Redis, and is written in Python. Hopefully, some things have already attracted your attention. For example, what could you use as a potential solution for Redis? You could do a simple lift and shift and run a VM with Redis on it. Or maybe you should consider using Memorystore, which is Google's managed Redis implementation. Business requirements are critical because they can determine whether a solution is acceptable. You should keep business requirements in mind when determining which solutions are appropriate. An organization's business requirements can act as a filter to reduce the number of potential available solutions, helping you to determine which is the correct one for a given scenario. Cymbal Direct's management wants to ensure that the company's applications can easily scale to handle demand so that Cymbal Direct can expand to more test markets. Business leaders also want to: Streamline development for application modernization and new features and products. Ensure that developers spend as much time on core business functionality as possible, without having to worry about scalability. Let partners order directly through an API. And get a production version of the social media highlighting service functional, while they ensure that no inappropriate content is distributed. Much like business requirements, technical requirements help you determine which potential solutions would be appropriate for your cloud architecture. You determine that Cymbal Direct's technical requirements are: Move to managed services wherever possible. Ensure that developers can deploy container-based workloads to testing and production environments in a highly scalable environment. Standardize on containers where possible, but also let existing virtualization infrastructure run without a re-write, so it can be slowly refactored over time. Securely allow partner integration. You'll often see patterns repeat themselves: business requirements that are very similar to technical requirements, or the opposite. You probably noticed these similarities in Cymbal Direct's requirements. Let's explore how you could use these requirements to help inform your decision-making. We'll focus on just one aspect of Cymbal Direct's environment: the delivery by drone business. For this project, you need to propose a Google Cloud solution for the website frontend, pilot, and truck management systems, all of which run on Kubernetes. For technical requirements you have to: Move to managed services wherever possible. Ensure that developers can deploy container-based workloads to testing and production environments in a highly scalable environment. And standardize on containers where possible. To check your work you can ask, "Does it…" Easily scale to handle additional demand when needed? and, does it streamline development? After defining requirements, a critical part of your role as a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct is to translate those requirements into solutions. You need to define the compute, network, and storage resources that will meet your requirements. Let's examine a potential solution. This is not intended to be a complete example, but it includes some of the products and services that could be part of your proposed solution. To begin, your solution has a global external Application Load Balancer and runs on Google Kubernetes Engine. In a real example, you would probably have more information about the GKE setup. You use separate projects for the website and management components. You could also consider what reference architectures already exist that would support your potential solution. Check your workbook for the complete Potential Solutions table. Cymbal Direct needs to evaluate the potential options the organization could use to implement a web frontend that is currently running in their on-premises VMs. As a Cloud Architect you could use a decision flow diagram to evaluate Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Run, and Google Kubernetes Engine to see if they meet the business and technical requirements you have identified. Compute Engine and App Engine fail to meet the "container-based" requirement, so they are eliminated from consideration. Cloud Run and GKE both meet the requirements of being "container-based", "streamline development", and "scale", but when considering the last requirement of "managed service", one choice remains in this example decision tree: Cloud Run. In this example situation, Cloud Run appears to be the best potential solution, but you will still need to check if there are any limiting factors, such as stateful applications, which are not currently supported in Cloud Run. Cymbal Direct has chosen to use GKE initially because it already runs Kubernetes. However, Cymbal Direct is evaluating Cloud Run for future use, or for some of the applications that are worth investigating. Often, representing your solution graphically will help you understand it in a different way, which is very helpful when you present or explain your solution to the stakeholders. This diagram is an example of what part of Cymbal Direct's architecture could look like. The diagram includes separate projects for development, testing, staging, and production. Two regions are used in the US to ensure high availability. Folders are used with IAM to simplify access controls. And an external IP with a global load balancer and Cloud Armor are included as well. Remember, that this is just an overview of the kind of work you will do as a Professional Cloud Architect. You might have a separate item for "firewall" in your existing environment where you describe in detail your firewall rules. Your solution plan will probably have a lot more detail about the various resources. This is much of what the other classes are about in your preparation journey: they help you learn the details about your options with Google Cloud and what information you might need to know about a particular resource to follow Google-recommended practices. Google's Cloud Architecture Center has reference architectures you can use as a starting point. These architectures can save time and help you get started with a solution design. After determining the architecture for your solution, you create a migration plan for how Cymbal Direct will move its applications to Google Cloud. Your role also involves envisioning how Cymbal Direct's business might transform in the future and plan how your solution can adapt as business and technical requirements change. For the delivery by drone service, you anticipate addressing potential future improvements by moving to Cloud Run.

It's your turn to assess your experience and skills related to this section with some diagnostic questions. Remember, these questions are intended to help you understand, or diagnose, which areas you'll want to focus on in your study plan, so we don't expect you to know all the answers yet. Please complete the diagnostic questions that are presented next. If your learning platform does not support assessments, kindly use your Course Workbook.

The diagnostic questions in this course can be challenging, and some of them have several layers or decisions to make. Let's examine some approaches you can use when analyzing complicated questions through a detailed discussion of three diagnostic questions from this first module. Let's start with question 3. First, consider the question stem. We can break the stem up into multiple parts. First, the scenario: "Cymbal Direct developers have written a new application. Based on initial usage estimates, you decide to run the application on Compute Engine instances with 15 Gb of RAM and 4 CPUs. These instances store persistent data locally. After the application runs for several months, historical data indicates that the application requires 30 Gb of RAM." The key points here are the technical details - you initially run the application on Compute Engine instances with 15 GB of RAM and 4 CPUs, but the application is requiring 30Gb of RAM. Also, you need to have a solution that will allow you to store persistent data locally. Next, you can identify the goal: Cymbal Direct management wants you to make adjustments that will minimize costs. So, in order to minimize costs, what should you do? In this question, each of the responses has you take similar steps. You stop the instance, then use a gCloud command to set the machine type, determine whether to set the instance's metadata to preemptible, and restart the instance. This requires you to make two choices: what machine type to set… … and whether to use preemptible machines. Once you make one of those decisions, you are left with two possible choices. In this case, because the instances need to store persistent data locally, you can't use preemptible machines, which eliminates B and D. Evaluating the two remaining choices, you know that an e2-standard-8 instance will have the appropriate amount of memory. However, this instance type will have more CPU than necessary and incur additional unnecessary costs. That leaves C as the correct answer. Custom instances are a good way to optimize costs because you don't have to pay for resources you don't need. Remember that the standard instance sizes are based on what makes sense for most general purpose applications, but your environment may differ. Next, let's focus on question 4. This question stem tells you that: You plan to set up a Dedicated interconnect between two of your data centers and want to ensure that your resources are only deployed to the same regions where your data centers are located. You need to make sure that you don't have any overlapping IP addresses that could cause conflicts when you set up the interconnect. You want to use RFC 1918 (nineteen - eighteen) class B address space. Notice the key criteria: * Resources deployed to the same regions as the data centers * No overlapping IP addresses * RFC 1918 class B address space Similar to question 3, these choices have you complete a series of similar steps. The first difference between the responses is whether you want to leave the default network in place or whether you delete the default VPC network and set up a new network that uses either auto mode or custom mode. Continuing to compare the responses, notice that you also need to decide on the network range to use to create subnets. You can eliminate A because default mode networks create subnets for you automatically in each zone and could allow people to accidentally provision resources in other regions. You can also eliminate B because auto mode networks also create subnets for you automatically in each zone. This leaves you with two options for setting up the network in custom mode. You can eliminate D because subnets are regional, not zonal. That leaves C as the correct answer. A custom mode VPC network does not automatically create subnets. This type of network provides you with complete control over its subnets and IP address ranges. You decide which subnets to create, in regions you choose, and which IP address ranges you use for subnets, but only if they fall within the RFC 1918 address space. RFC 1918 Class B uses the 172.16.x.x address space. Finally, let's examine question 9. This question stem has a clear scenario setup: You are working in a mixed environment of VMs and Kubernetes. Some of your resources are on-premises, and some are in Google Cloud. Using containers as a part of your CI/CD pipeline has sped up releases significantly. Next, you have a goal: You want to start migrating some of those VMs to containers so you can get similar benefits. You want to automate the migration process where possible. Let's identify some key information: * Some of your resources are on-premises, and some are in Google Cloud * Migrating some of those VMs to containers * Automate the migration process Keep these points in mind as you evaluate the options. You can approach the sets of choices in this question in a few ways, but let's first identify the different Google options you could use to automate migration of VMs to containers. The responses give you three options: Migrate to Containers (Migrate for Anthos), Cloud Build, and Migrate for Compute Engine. You can eliminate C because Cloud Build lets you build Docker-compatible containers, but you can't use it to automate the importing of VMs. You can also eliminate D because you can't use Migrate for Compute Engine to create containers. Now that both your remaining options use Migrate to Containers (Migrate for Anthos), you need to make a choice based on how to use the product. Migrate to Containers (Migrate for Anthos) uses containers in GKE to migrate the VMs; It does not use Compute Engine instances. So, you can eliminate B. This leaves you with A as the correct answer. You must initially create a GKE cluster. Then you can use Migrate to Containers (Migrate for Anthos) to set up the cluster and import the VMs. Migrate to Containers (Migrate for Anthos) is a very powerful tool that can be used to import VMs to GKE. It automates the configuration of a GKE cluster and the importing of the VMs. Migrate for Compute Engine is also a useful tool, but instead converts VMs to Compute Engine instances. Use the approach that helps you as you answer diagnostic questions throughout this course. Remember to read the question stem carefully, and identify the key points and requirements. Some questions have multiple parts. Consider each of the requirements posed by the question. Find the similarities and differences in the responses, and eliminate responses that do not meet the requirements.

Welcome to Module 2: Managing and Provisioning a Solution Infrastructure. In this module, you'll explore the scope of tasks involved in managing and provisioning Cymbal Direct's solution infrastructure in Google Cloud, which corresponds to section 2 of the Professional Cloud Architect Exam Guide. We'll start by discussing some of the considerations involved in configuring Cymbal Direct's infrastructure. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through 10 diagnostic questions. Then, we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

- [YouTube: Provisioning a cloud solution to meet Cymbal Direct’s requirements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OpMYiz5Nvk)

Let's begin by exploring the role of a Professional Cloud Architect in provisioning and deploying a solution on Google Cloud that meets Cymbal Direct's requirements. As a Professional Cloud Architect, you need to understand the cloud computing services available, how to configure them, and most importantly, how to select the right service for the task at hand. You already chose networking, compute, and storage resources for Cymbal Direct's cloud solutions. Now your task is to determine how to use those resources optimally for Cymbal Direct's needs. It's important to understand the scope of the configuration choices that you'll have to make as a Professional Cloud Architect, because they will determine how to best use the resources available to you in Google Cloud. It often helps to start at with a broad approach and decide what products you'd like to use, like we did in the last module. Next, focus on the different products, services, and practices and decide how to best implement them in Google Cloud. Although many architects are competent in many technical areas, you are not an implementation engineer or a data engineer. For example, as a Professional Cloud Architect, you might decide to configure one service account for read-only access to Spanner, and a separate service account for writes. However, designing and configuring database schema is more appropriate to a data or implementation engineer, so you would not make those configuration decisions unless that is also your role. To get feedback on Cymbal Direct's delivery by drone initiative, you decided to meet with some of the pilots. One complaint was that occasional latency was causing slow drone response to commands sent by pilots. You realized that the service was initially set up with DNS load balancing to ensure traffic could easily be sent to a second region, but this resulted in some traffic being sent to locations further away. You decided to move to a global external Application Load Balancer and use a custom network with only nearby regions to ensure low latency when streaming data from the drones. You looked at the default and auto-mode networks, but realized that a custom-mode network would prevent the network from deploying resources to regions with high latency and choose the global external Application Load Balancer because it gave a single, global IP address, which routes traffic to the closest backend. Not using the default network meant that you actively had to configure your firewall rules, and not just inherit the default rules for http, https, icmp, ssh, and rdp. After making the decision to use custom mode networks instead of default network, you decide to ensure that this practice is followed by configuring an organization policy constraint. You decided to set two constraint policies, "compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation" and "compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks." This will prevent a default network from being created for new projects and ensure that resources are only deployed to approved subnets; reducing the possibility of drone pilots experiencing latency. For more information on organizational policy constraints, see our online documentation. Cymbal Direct has decided to deploy containers to Cloud Run for new services to address the technical requirement to standardize on containers and favor managed services. You looked at GKE, Compute Engine, and Anthos and chose to use a mix of compute options. Because Cymbal Direct wants to ensure their applications scale with minimal latency, you decided to configure Cloud Run with a relatively high number of minimum instances. This reduces the number of cold starts by ensuring that Cymbal Direct has containers available to facilitate new requests. Cloud Run is the preferred option. However, GKE lets Cymbal Direct lift-and-shift the application from the existing environment. Compute Engine lets Cymbal Direct use existing monolithic applications that would run on VMs, while still providing the benefit of Google Cloud's scalability, programmatic access, and low costs. For deployments that have stateful information such as databases, or where the developer prefers to preserve their existing workflow, you've chosen to leverage GKE for their website frontend, and pilot, and truck management systems running on Kubernetes. You have also decided to leverage GKE's autoscaling features, and re-use many of the same deployments from your previous Kubernetes cluster. This allowed your developers to preserve their existing workflows, continue to use kubectl, and met business and technical watchpoints to favor managed services and ensure scalability. For their Compute Engine instances, you've decided to use managed instance groups with Shielded VMs. Cymbal Direct looked at unmanaged instance groups, but their applications wouldn't be as scalable and would cost more money unnecessarily. Because Cymbal Direct uses Ubuntu for their existing API servers and SuSE for the new social media integration service, you realized that they could deploy these applications as Shielded VMs and get the extra security benefits. Cymbal Direct wants to store video of the drone-based deliveries for review and future analysis. You looked at Filestore and Cloud Storage, but you chose Cloud Storage because of its scalability, its ability to reduce costs by changing storage classes, and because the data stored is not relational or structured. Storing drone-based video data is a new service, so you spoke with the developers about how often you thought they would need access to archival video. Because the developers do not know how often the data will be read, you decide to start by writing data to a standard storage. The developers expect a large amount of video data; therefore, you recommend a lifecycle policy to delete videos after 30 days. Developers can copy specific videos that they want to retain to another bucket. You explain to developers that if they need to retain videos for additional time, you can change the lifecycle management policy to set the data to a less expensive tier of storage based on how frequently the video needs to be accessed.

## Designing for Security and Compliance

Identifying the security and compliance considerations pertinent to Cymbal's cloud solution

### Video - [Designing for security and compliance with Cymbal Direct’s cloud solution](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/78/video/517354)

- [YouTube: Designing for security and compliance with Cymbal Direct’s cloud solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWW2d9XtMLY)

Let's begin by exploring the role of a Professional Cloud Architect in designing a Google Cloud solution that meets Cymbal Direct's requirements for security and compliance. When designing a solution, an architect might have business or technical requirements that are specific to security or compliance. If you're designing a solution for a financial institution, for example, this will almost certainly be the case. For Cymbal Direct, and most companies, security is going to be integral to all aspects of your design decisions. It isn't just properly configuring a network firewall. Cymbal Direct has a straightforward environment from a security point of view. You have several different types of users who will have different levels of access to different services. Some will be employees, but others will be customers who need to access the web-based store. As a baseline, you want to ensure that you expose services as little as possible, and when a service is accessed, users only can access what they need, and nothing more. This is referred to as "the principle of least privilege." Because Cymbal Direct isn't a bank or healthcare provider, you have fewer compliance concerns than companies that work in those or similar industries. However, you will need to meet some level of compliance requirements as you architect a solution. Google has to deal with these kinds of issues too, and it offers tools you can use to meet compliance requirements. People who work in the security industry often tell a story about campers and a bear. It goes as follows: Several friends go camping and are sitting around a campfire when a giant bear charges from the forest. Everyone runs, and while doing so, the campers realize that the bear can't catch everyone, only the slowest camper. In the same way hackers won't attack every target, only the most vulnerable. Hackers most probably aren't specifically targeting Cymbal Direct, but as a Professional Cloud Architect, you should design the solution to be as secure as possible. It should be at least as—if not more—secure than other potential targets. Be as difficult as possible to catch: use tools like the integrated firewall in your VPC network. But don't just stop there, consider tools like Cloud Armor, hardened versions of Linux, secure boot, and the many other options Google provides. Assume you will be attacked: limit the scope of what's available to the attackers as much as possible. Projects are a good example of how to view other security in Google Cloud. Cymbal Direct could certainly take a straightforward approach to their cloud architecture and put all of their cloud resources in one single project. Having a single project isn't wrong, and for a simple environment it can work effectively. However, Cymbal Direct has several services. Creating a dedicated project for each service would limit the damage that could be done if one of Cymbal Direct's services were compromised. You certainly should keep things like our development, testing, and staging resources separate. Could projects be one way to do that? – Of course. Each service could have a dedicated folder containing projects for development, testing, and staging. What about access? You can scope Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to specific projects, allowing a developer an appropriate level of access in one project - such as staging - and a different level of access, or none at all, in another project. Since projects are in your resource hierarchy, access is simple to manage too. You can have IAM policies that are applied at a higher level in your organization, such as a folder. The policies can be inherited, or applied to just that project, or just to the resources in it. This makes them easy to manage. As a Professional Cloud Architect, you need to consider other ways to design for security as you create Cymbal Direct's cloud solutions. Although projects don't exist solely because of their security features, the way you use projects can help ensure the security of your solution. The same is true for many other aspects of your architecture in Google Cloud. Because security is an ever-present concern, most resources in Google Cloud have security features you can enable. For example, although security is not the primary function of load balancers, you can use their security features for Cymbal Direct's solution to help it scale during times of peak delivery or absorb traffic from a denial of service attack. Let's take another example of how you can consider security in your solution design. The only person who should be able to connect to a Cymbal Direct delivery drone is the pilot; the URLs shouldn't be exposed to the world. In your design, you can enable Cloud Armor to limit what you expose by only having URL mappings to just the parts of your application that you want accessible. Cymbal Direct has two experimental services in development: delivery by drone and social media integration. As a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal, your role is to consider potential compliance issues and account for them in your solution design. You are also responsible for ensuring the solution complies with any compliance requirements. For example: What happens if a drone records a video of someone's personal information? What happens if the social media integration service imports some content from a social media post that does have Cymbal Direct's product in it, but also has inappropriate adult content? Both scenarios might have some legal implications. Fortunately, although the specific implementation might be somewhat unique (drones) the issue (exposing PII) isn't. The same for the social media integration service. Cymbal Direct also might have information that has been collected about your customer's preferences, or purchases. Laws might determine when and if a user deletes their account, how long you can retain information, or if you can retain user information at all. This could be different based on what country or state the user lives in. If you are given a directive by Cymbal Direct's management to ensure that user data is be deleted, you can use a Lifecycle Policy if that data was stored in Cloud Storage. One almost universal concern is how to handle credit card data if you are processing credit card transactions yourself. This is often governed by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS). Google also has to adhere to this standard in many areas of its business. Google provides many different tools that you can use to meet your legal requirements. If you know that a solution is going to involve a compliance standard, se e what the Google Cloud documentation says about it. You might need to take specific steps or sign agreements with Google regarding those standards.

### Video - [Optimizing Cymbal Direct’s technical and business processes and procedures for the cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/78/video/517361)

- [YouTube: Optimizing Cymbal Direct’s technical and business processes and procedures for the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW8_3xTxg2M)

Let's begin by exploring the role of a Professional Cloud Architect in optimizing Cymbal Direct's technical and business processes and procedures for the cloud. Cymbal Direct has several initiatives in progress in addition to the existing web-based retail business, which is focused on footwear and clothing. As a Professional Cloud Architect, you will need to ensure that you understand the requirements from both a business and technical perspective. After you understand the requirements, you can then look at the existing environment. Some of the processes in place will govern how the environment is interacted with. Those processes might meet the requirements, but they might need to change if they don't. The requirements will always come from stakeholders and serve the business' needs, but you might have to analyze the processes and see if they can still be used, if they need to be modified, or if you need to propose new ones. Let's review Cymbal Direct's business and technical requirements in the next slides. Cymbal Direct's management wants to make sure that they can easily scale to handle additional demand when needed, so that they can feel comfortable with expanding to more test markets. Streamline development for application modernization and new features/products. Ensure that developers spend as much time on core business functionality as possible, without having to worry about scalability wherever possible. Allow for partners to order directly through an API. Get a production version of the social media highlighting service deployed , and ensure no inappropriate content. When analyzing the business requirements, you want to look for duplicate or conflicting items. You can also look at other ways of meeting your business requirements if you need to change your solution. These are Cymbal Direct's technical requirements: Move to managed services wherever possible. Ensure that developers can deploy container-based workloads to testing and production environments in a highly scalable infrastructure. Standardize on containers where possible, but also allow for existing virtualization infrastructure to run without changes without a rewrite, so that it can be slowly refactored over-time. Securely allow partner integration. Allow for streaming of IoT data from drones. You can often rephrase the requirements as questions and use them as tests to ensure that your solution meets the requirements For example, "Move to managed services wherever possible" could be rephrased as "Did we move to a managed service if it was possible?" The current build process at Cymbal Direct is: Package a monolithic application with its dependencies Check code in and notify the QA team they need to test it Stress test the application to ensure it performs well Build a VM image for deployment This looks like it fails to meet several of the business and technical requirements. The diagram shows an example of an automated ci/cd pipeline. It starts with a planning phase, code is then checked into a source code repository, which triggers a build, which is tested. At each stage of this process, collectively known as the continuous integration phase, a failure will prevent further traversal of the pipeline. The continuous deployment phase consists of tagging the new successful build as a release, potential manual review, and deployment which typically creates some type of artifact (Docker image, VM for example), which is then deployed to production, or staging, depending on the environment, finally, the operation and monitoring stage (sometimes shown separately) allows for feedback and learning to be integrated back to the planning stage for the next release. By using a CI/CD pipeline, Cymbal Direct gets a lot of value. It speeds up builds and ensures a consistent minimum level of quality. Having code automatically built and deployed also makes it very easy to revert to previous version if necessary. As a Professional Cloud Architect, your role involves analyzing this build process to determine if it meets your requirements. You identify that it does not meet the business requirements to streamline development and enable developers to focus on core business functionality. You also determine that the process does not meet the technical requirements to move to managed services wherever possible and to deploy container-based workloads. You want to define a new process to optimize the CI/CD pipeline. In the new process, developers implement new features as microservices in Docker containers. When new code is checked in, it triggers an automated CI/CD pipeline to test and release the newly built Docker image. The new version is automatically deployed to Cloud Run. This process provides several benefits. First, it is much easier to scale each microservice than it is to scale a monolithic application. Second, by using Docker containers, Cymbal Direct will meet the requirement to standardize on containerized workloads, which creates a more consistent environment from team to team and environment to environment. Finally, by deploying to Cloud Run you are favoring a managed service, so developers don't need to worry about scale, which will provide more time to implement features that matter. This is a high-level example of a process, and a real life build/deployment process would contain much more detail. This is simplified for time purposes, but is representative of the reasoning behind analyzing and defining new processes. As a Professional Cloud Architect you might recommend adopting approaches that will help improve reliability and and stability. One approach is to refactor monolithic applications to microservices. Microservices are isolated from each other, so it is much easier to release and roll-back independent units of code. Changes are isolated, so breaking things due to unknown interdependence is less likely, and microservices are easier to test because of their more limited scope. However, they can be difficult to implement initially. For example, if Cymbal Direct has a monolithic application that customers are using and getting value from, the best technical solution might be to re-factor the application by using microservices, but this solution might be different from what the customer or stakeholders actually want. If the current application is creating value, they might want to avoid making major changes. A compromise approach could be to slowly refactor this monolith into a microservice architecture as changes are made as part of a continuous improvement approach. If you want to adopt microservice design patterns, you should implement them with new services. Because using a microservices approach accelerates feature deployment, it creates a more streamlined business process. You can have both the older approach for existing applications, and microservices for new ones. It's not all or nothing. Understanding how to manage change, deploy resources, and ensure stakeholders are happy is a crucial skill you should have as a Professional Cloud Architect. As a Professional Cloud Architect, your role involves developing procedures to ensure that Cymbal Direct's cloud solutions are reliable in production. Although this course is not going to become a philosophy class, you should consider an aspect of philosophy when you build procedures to ensure the reliability of the processes you identified There is a stoic ideology that advocates taking time to embrace your fears, and not just metaphorically. If you were afraid of being poor, it says that you should become poor by locking away your worldly possessions and living without money for a few days. The belief is that you would overcome the challenge. Let's take this philosophical approach into the present. If you are afraid that your systems will crash, this philosophy would probably advocate for intentionally crashing them. Today, this approach is called chaos engineering and some applications, such as Chaos Monkey, will intentionally crash systems by randomly turning them off. As a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct, you consider two types of procedures: chaos engineering and penetration testing. You consider how chaos engineering approaches can help you continuously improve the social media application and to lead to a more robust system design. You also want to ensure the security of IoT data streaming from Cymbal Direct's delivery by drone service. You follow Google-recommended practices and draft penetration testing procedures to mimic the behavior of someone who is trying to hack your system. You want to conduct penetration testing regularly and, whenever changes are made to the system, such as when the delivery by drone application is upgraded, when security patches are applied, or when policies addressing customer use are modified. You believe that developing both of these procedures will have immense value for Cymbal Direct and its customers and will make your systems more secure and resilient.

- [YouTube: Implementation, operations, and reliability at Cymbal Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ys8q3biR4)

Let's begin by considering the role of a Professional Cloud Architect in implementation, operations, and reliability at Cymbal Direct. Although a Professional Cloud Architect is not an implementation engineer, you will have many of the same skills. You should know the best practices for development and deployment and how to investigate best practices in areas you are unfamiliar with. You shouldn't just stop there; you should be comfortable with the ways you can interact with Google Cloud. You should also understand the various methods you can use to manage your configuration, release code updates, and monitor your environment. Let's explore how you'd use these skills as a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct. At Cymbal Direct, your role as an architect goes beyond replacing a hypervisor that is running virtual machines with a solution that uses Compute Engine. You must investigate the best practices around how to approach all the areas of your service. Deployment is one area where many organizations have historically suffered. Cymbal Direct has several initiatives. Some initiatives use older monolithic applications, and some initiatives provide new services that are in active development. Although an architect isn't a developer, you play a critical role in helping plan how the developers write and design software to optimize the use of cloud resources. For example, you could help use aspects of the cloud like elasticity. You could save up to 80% of the cost of running VMs by working with a development or operations team to understand whether their code can run on a preemptible (spot) instance. As a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct, you could discuss how developers can adopt a practice of externalizing state to help facilitate the use of spot instances and to leverage autoscaling. If state information is retained in the VM, the state will not be available when the VM isn't running. Having state information retained in the VM would prevent using spot instances because they can be terminated at any time. Consider the cost of running a fixed number of instances compared to a managed instance group with an autoscaling policy. The dynamically provisioned instances (which could also potentially be containers) are started when demand increases, and they are stopped when demand decreases. If Cymbal Direct wants to implement a solution like this, they won't have the additional expense of running and having to pay for instances when they're not needed. Understanding programmatic access is important as a Professional Cloud Architect because it helps you design a solution that stakeholders like developers will accept. Programmatic access is also important for security. At Cymbal Direct, there will be several projects and several environments for each project (staging, production, test, and development). You want to ensure that developers can easily access the resources in the appropriate environment and project, but not elsewhere. This task could be performed by accessing Cloud Shell, the Google Cloud console, or a variety of APIs. You also need to ensure that some form of network access lets developers enter those environments. For their social media integration service, developers have been given IAM roles that let them create new Compute Engine images and templates and deploy them. As a Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct, you want to make sure that your organization uses Google Cloud as efficiently as possible. For example, if your developers generally stop working at 5 PM, should you still be paying for instances running in your development, staging, and test environments overnight? Probably not. What if instead the resources for each of your developers could automatically be created on the fly using Terraform and then automatically be destroyed? Your role involves recommending this type of cost-efficient solution. The nature of working in a cloud environment has had a significant impact on the methodologies you use to manage configuration and code updates. For example, while configuration management tools such as Terraform and Ansible cannot instantiate a physical server, these tools let you spin up a Compute Engine instance programmatically in the cloud. There are literally thousands of excellent tools that you can use to gain visibility in your environment. Prometheus, Grafana, and even older tools like MRTG and Nagios - all of these will get the job done when it comes to monitoring your environment and gaining visibility. None of these are part of Google Cloud the way that Google Cloud Observability is. As a Professional Cloud Architect, you may not be able to decide what primary monitoring applications are used in your environment. They may have been in place for years, and deeply integrated into your processes. Most Google Services like GKE or Compute Engine will seamlessly integrate with Google Cloud Observability. You can see startup and shutdown events and general performance graphs. As a Professional Cloud Architect you should know how to use it to keep track of Key Performance Indicators and use other tools like Error Reporting, Tracing, and Logging. At Cymbal Direct, the logs from Compute Engine instances and Kubernetes provide visibility into operating Cymbal Direct's various services. When it comes to defining KPIs, however, you'll need to meet with the stakeholders for each of the different services to determine the metrics you'll use to determine success. For example, the latency acceptable when a customer tries to complete a purchase from the web store and the latency acceptable when loading images from social media services in a product page will be different. Once you have defined the metrics to track, you can use Google Cloud Observability to do so, as well as send notifications and alerts if appropriate.

- [YouTube: Identify and itemize objectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEMHTKAH-mk)

The next step in analyzing a case is to identify and itemize the case objectives by turning a complicated problem into smaller, simpler problems. Taking this step lets you get an overall familiarity with the solution and ensure that any objectives or requirements that might not be directly mentioned in the case's business and technical requirements have been identified. Add these new objectives and requirements to the list of business or technical objectives, and consider whether they point you to a particular solution. Take each sentence in your case study, and rewrite it as an objective. An objective could be an existing architectural component that needs to be migrated, a requirement, or a task that needs to be completed. If a sentence is too complex to be summarized by one objective, turn it into multiple objectives. Let's look at a paragraph from Dress4Win's Case Study. In this paragraph, key words are highlighted. Pay attention to words that might eliminate or direct your attention to a particular solution. Key words such as "all", "never", and "must" might eliminate some options. Also, key words might mention a geographic location and a new requirement such as low latency or compliance. Identify these new objectives in your case study notes. This step can be omitted, especially for experienced architects. Separate each item into different line or objective. This step might be omitted, especially for experienced architects. However, taking this step ensures that you don't miss any objectives or requirements as you follow a methodical approach. When you go through the official exam case studies, it's important to familiarize yourself with all of the potential objectives so that you are not surprised by anything on the exam. This step helps to add clarity and identify some important themes. In this example from Dress4Win, the case mentions growth several times. At the end of this step, you should have a list of itemized objectives. This slide shows a simplified, easier to read version of our previous list. This table can function as a to-do list. You might have also noticed some notes, but it would be equally valid to have a separate document, or save those for a later stage. You should have a simple, clear, and easy to understand list of objectives that can be used in the next step.

It's important to emphasize again that this isn't the only approach to this process, or "the official Google approach to analyzing components" - it's an example process. There are other approaches to analyzing components which are discussed in other classes in the cloud architecture learning pathway. Initially, you'll simply generate a list of potential solutions to ensure you haven't missed any potential solutions. This ensures your experience or preferences will not artificially limit your options. For almost all components in a solution, there will be compute, storage, and network requirements. Since most solutions will require these, it makes sense to ensure you understand those requirements first. Next, you can compile a list of all potential solutions that you could use which meet those requirements. Once you have a list of possible components, you need to refine the list to eliminate the components that do not meet your business and technical requirements. At this point, all the remaining services should meet your requirements. Those are potential solution components. Let's look at how you might take these steps to address networking requirements using examples from Dress4Win's case study where multiple potential solutions meet the requirements. There are several facets of the network you must consider when reviewing the Dress4Win case study. Let's start by looking at the requirement for connectivity between the Dress4Win data center and Google Cloud, and consider some of the potential solutions. Dress4Win requires that any solution support multiple private connections between its production data center and the cloud environment. There are several potential solutions you could identify to meet this objective. Cloud VPN, Partner Interconnect, and Dedicated Interconnects all support private connections to provide connectivity between the production data center and Google Cloud. Next, filter the options to evaluate which are appropriate for your solution. You should evaluate each business and technical requirement to ensure the remaining solutions meet your requirements. Cloud VPN may be used to give developers access to the testing and development environments discussed in the case study and may be an obvious solution. However, the case study indicates Dress4Win wants to fully migrate its production environment eventually, so while Cloud VPN may provide high availability on a regional basis and for lower bandwidths sufficient for testing and development environments, it may not be the best choice to address the speed and growth requirements of a full production environment. Both Partner Interconnect and Dedicated Interconnects provide high performance and high availability that Dress4Win requires. The case indicates that a reduction in the total cost of operation is a key business requirement. Operating through a service provider may not provide Dress4Win with the scalability and speed to innovate that the organization requires. Dedicated Interconnect provides multiple interconnects for high availability and would be managed by Dress4Win so it may offer an optimal solution to address all Dress4Win's requirements. Evaluating each objective separately helps ensure you do not overlook any of the requirements. Dress4Win has an active social network and monetizes user and supplier interactions in a number of ways. The case study indicates Dress4Win currently uses three RabbitMQ servers for messaging, social notifications, and events. Let's look at some of the potential options when considering how to provide a component of our architecture that provides or replaces Dress4Win's RabbitMQ servers. This is a fairly straight-forward example, but there are often keywords you can identify as indicators for potential services. Mobile apps often include Firestore as a database, on-premises Kubernetes can point to Anthos, etc. Messaging or Queueing often indicates Pub/Sub is a good choice. Let's look a little deeper at these two potential solutions to see which may provide a better option. RabbitMQ is a popular message queueing application. RabbitMQ can be deployed as a cluster (such as one running on Compute Engine instances), but there are a significant number of issues when deploying RabbitMQ, such as nodes leaving or joining the cluster and only allowing for an odd number of instances and thus would not be easy to scale. Pub/Sub provides an equivalent message queueing service, but as a managed service. This means no scaling issues to worry about. Additionally, Pub/Sub can be easily used to trigger Cloud Run functions, or integrate with other Google Cloud services. All of these may be useful today and in the future, making Pub/Sub the optimal solution. Let's look at a more formal analysis of the proposed product/solution for Dress4Win. This analysis demonstrates some of the considerations you might use to decide on an optimal solution. One component in Dress4Win's existing environment is MySQL. The case states that Dress4Win is unsure which of the components in its existing architecture could be migrated as is and which might need to change prior to migration. Thus, Dress4Win is open to either a lift-and-shift migration or to modifying the existing solution where necessary. As an architect, you may often get a requirement such as "We need to migrate our MySQL virtual machine to Google Cloud." You don't necessarily want to accept that requirement on face value. If you did, you'd choose Compute Engine. Dress4Win has a list of specific requirements for its MySQL instance. As an architect, it's important to consider all of the requirements when choosing between potential solutions. The Dress4Win case states the existing MySQL has a requirement of 128 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs. You know this requires the deployment of a custom-sized instance. Both Compute Engine and Cloud SQL can meet this requirement. Would Cloud SQL be a better option? If Google manages the MySQL instance for you, it will be done with best practices. Using a managed service lets the database administrator focus on other, more important tasks. Enabling a managed, high availability implementation is very simple, and addresses one of Dress4Win's technical requirements. You might also consider if you would separate out user data, inventory, and static data, and move static data to Cloud Storage. Cost is always a concern, and is called out as an objective in the Dress4Win case. Use the pricing calculator to estimate the cost variance between the different potential solutions, Cloud SQL, Compute Engine, and Spanner, in addition to other components. The purpose of this course is to prepare you for the Professional Cloud Architecture track, and not to delve into all of the architectural decisions you will make. Spanner is a recommended solution for large, highly available databases, and Google advises favoring managed services. In a real environment, if you couldn't currently move to a managed database service, you could make a note for a future improvement, but it would be worth spending the time making sure your stakeholders understood the benefit before abandoning it as an option.

Now that you know one approach to analyze the certification exam's case studies, let's use the notes you've been taking throughout this course to put together a study plan for each week in your Professional Cloud Architect journey. Now that you've explored all six sections of the exam guide, consider what you've learned about your knowledge and skills through the diagnostic questions in this course. You should have a better understanding of what areas you need to focus on and what resources are available. Think about the answers to these questions: When will you take the exam? How many weeks does that give you to prepare? How many hours can you realistically spend preparing for the exam each week? How many total hours will you prepare? Be sure to leave enough time at the end of your plan to re-take the diagnostic questions and the sample questions, and fill in any gaps in your knowledge that may remain. Take a few minutes to think about how much time you will allocate to preparing for the exam and note your answers in the workbook. Use the template in your workbook to plan your study goals for each week. Consider: What exam guide section(s) or topic area(s) will you focus on? What courses (or specific modules) will help you learn more? What Skill Badges or labs will you work on for hands-on practice? What documentation links will you review? What additional resources will you use - such as sample questions? How will you prepare for the case studies? You may do some or all of these study activities each week. Let's review an example. If you've identified managed services as a particular area you need to study, you might choose to structure your study for a week to include targeted modules from the on-demand training, a related Skill Badge for hands-on practice, and documentation. Alternatively, you might choose one week to complete an entire course, and another week to focus on a Skill Badge. You can determine the approach that fits your existing skillset. Find the weekly study template at the end of your workbook. Duplicate the weekly template for the number of weeks in your individual preparation journey. Remember, you may need to adjust your plans based on the areas where you need to learn more. For more information about the resources we've discussed in this course, refer to your notes and the student copy of the slides.
