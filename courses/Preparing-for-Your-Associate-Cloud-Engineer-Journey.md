Person: So you're preparing for the Associate Cloud Engineer certification. But what exactly is an Associate Cloud Engineer? Let's review the job-role description. An Associate Cloud Engineer deploys and secures applications and infrastructure, monitors operations of multiple projects and maintains enterprise solutions to ensure that they meet target performance metrics. This individual has experience working with public clouds and on-premises solutions. They are able to use Google Cloud Console and the command line interface to perform common platform based tasks to maintain and scale one or more deployed solutions that leverage Google-managed or self-managed services on Google Cloud. In this course, you'll examine the role of an Associate Cloud Engineer by putting yourself in the shoes of an Associate Cloud Engineer at Cymbal Superstore, a fictional company that is preparing to migrate some of its on-premises applications to Google Cloud. Cymbal Superstore is experiencing several challenges common to legacy retailers. Customers increasingly expect a seamless online offline experience when they shop, making the Cymbal Superstore e-commerce application vital. Cymbal Superstore logistics wants to use data to more efficiently oversee transportation. Cymbal Superstore operations has been grappling with how to update their supply chain strategy to meet customer demand in a timely, efficient way. To meet these challenges, Cymbal Superstore plans to migrate their existing e-commerce, supply chain and transportation management applications to Google Cloud. As an Associate Cloud Engineer at Cymbal Superstore, your role involves helping set up the cloud environment. You're also involved in planning, configuring and managing the cloud solutions. This requires you to be familiar with variety of compute, storage and networking resources in Google Cloud. You also need a solid understanding of Google recommended practices for configuring access to cloud resources. As you continue through this course, you'll explore the role of an Associate Cloud Engineer as Cymbal Superstore migrates their applications to Google Cloud. We'll use this scenario to illustrate the types of configurations and tasks that correspond to each section of the exam guide. Cymbal Superstore's Cloud solutions will also provide context for many of the diagnostic questions you'll encounter along the way.

>> Why become a Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer? Becoming Google certified gives you industry recognition. It validates your technical expertise and can be the starting point to take your career to the next level. Certification value has skyrocketed. The associate cloud engineer certification is valuable on its own, and can also be used as a starting point on the path to professional certification. You may be curious about what separates an associate cloud certification from a professional cloud certification. There is some overlap between the two levels of certification. However, only the professional level certification expects the exam taker to know how to evaluate case studies and design solutions to meet business requirements. The associate level is mainly concerned with technical requirements and customer implementation. That is where you should concentrate your efforts.

### Video - [Certification process](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/77/video/523298)

- [YouTube: Certification process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frhl2VtvK9M)

The Associate Cloud Engineer certification exam is based on the exam guide. In the following modules, you'll take diagnostic questions to assess your knowledge of each section of the exam guide. The exam guide is divided into 5 sections. Each section has several objectives. We'll focus on where you can find resources at the section objective level. You can find the exam guide on the certification page, at the URL shown on the screen. Throughout this course, you'll be pointed to specific resources and documentation that can help you fill the gaps you identify through the diagnostic questions. Let's go over the types of resources you may want to include in your study plan. Google provides resources to help you develop your skills and experience with Google Cloud solutions. The learning path for this certification includes in-person or online courses, online practice labs and skill badges, and practice questions. The courses recommended for the Associate Cloud Engineer certification include Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure, Architecting with Google Compute Engine, and Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine. You'll learn more about how these courses relate to the sections of the exam guide as you complete the modules in this course. It's important to note that these courses can be taken as instructor-led courses, or as on-demand courses on Coursera, Pluralsight, or Google's Cloud Skills Boost. The on-demand content included in Architecting with Google Compute Engine is presented over three courses: Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation, Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services, and Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation. The Skill Badges provide hands-on experience working in Google Cloud. They consist of a series of related labs followed by a challenge lab, and are available on Cloud Skills Boost. As we review the diagnostic questions in this course, you'll also get recommendations for Skill Badges to include in your study plan. Sample questions are another resource that you can use to prepare. The diagnostic questions in this course are designed to help you identify your knowledge gaps. On the certification page, Google provides a different set of sample questions that can help you familiarize yourself with the format of the exam questions. Once you complete the question set, you will receive feedback describing the rationale for the correct answers. The sample questions provide a good opportunity to practice taking the type of scenario-based, application-level questions on the exam. The exam questions present you with a scenario, explain the goal or what you are trying to achieve, and ask you what you would do in this situation. Remember these tips for multiple choice questions: Read the question stem carefully. Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Try to anticipate the correct answer before looking at the options. You should be able to come up with the correct answer just from reading the question stem. You may find that more than one answer may be possible on multiple choice tests. Take questions at face value. If certain details are omitted, then they are unlikely to contribute to the selection of the best answer. Pay attention to the qualifiers, such as "usually", "all", "never", and "none". And the key words, such as "the best", "the least", "except". Google also supplies official public documentation for its products and services. This documentation can be found at the URL shown on the screen. In each of the following modules, you'll learn about specific documentation resources to help you study that section in preparation for the exam.

One of the primary goals for this course is to help you devise a study strategy that focuses on the areas you need to work on. Let's quickly explore how the course is set up. The course - and your course workbook - focuses on each section of the exam guide in turn. To help you craft a study strategy, you'll take diagnostic questions as part of each module. Many of these questions relate to our Cymbal Superstore scenario and ask you to apply concepts you will need to be familiar with as an Associate Cloud Engineer. Keep in mind that these diagnostic questions are meant to help you identify gaps in your knowledge, but they don't represent all possible topics on the exam. Remember, we don't expect that you'll answer all these questions correctly right now. This is meant to be a course that you take toward the beginning of your Associate Cloud Engineer journey, and many of you may not be Google Cloud experts yet. If there are any terms or concepts that are confusing, please ask. We'll review the answers to the questions related to each section objective. As we cover each objective, you'll learn more about where the key concepts appear in Google Cloud documentation, specific courses and modules, and/or specific Skill Badges. At the end of each section objective, you'll find a list of related resources. Mark or highlight the specific resources you need to add to your study plan. In the final part of your workbook, you'll find a template to help you identify weekly goals and study activities. We'll talk more about putting together weekly goals at the end of this course. Now that you know about the overall setup of this course and how to use the workbook, let's get started by exploring section 1 of the exam guide.

In this module, you'll explore the scope of tasks involved in setting up a cloud solution environment, which corresponds to the first section of the Associate Cloud Engineer Exam Guide. We'll start by discussing some considerations for how you would set up Cymbal Superstore's cloud environment. Next, you'll assess your skills in this section through 8 diagnostic questions. Then, we'll review these questions. Based on the areas you need to learn more about, you'll identify resources to include in your study plan.

### Video - [Setting up Cymbal Superstore's cloud environment](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/77/video/523302)

- [YouTube: Setting up Cymbal Superstore's cloud environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBmap0d5FwU)

Let's start with how to set up Cymbal Superstore's cloud environment. Cymbal Superstore is ready to start implementing basic cloud infrastructure for their organization. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you have been assigned to the team to help with this phase of the project. The team begins with a planning meeting to decide how Cymbal Superstore's cloud structure will be organized. The outcomes of this phase of the migration journey include establishing a resource hierarchy, implementing organizational policies, managing projects and quotas, managing users and groups, and applying access management. Setting up billing and monitoring the use of your cloud resources are also things to consider. Let's take a closer look. How to set up a resource hierarchy on Google Cloud depends on the needs and structure of the organization. Cymbal Superstore plans to migrate three applications to the cloud: its supply chain application, which will run on VMs; its containerized ecommerce application, which will use GKE; and its transportation management application, which will use Cloud Run functions to track truck location. These applications correspond to three different departments. Operations manages the B2B supply chain, Logistics oversees transportation, and Sales & Marketing manages the eCommerce application. The graphic shows a possible organizational hierarchy for Cymbal Superstore. The Cymbal Superstore organization is at the top, followed by optional folders underneath, one for each division and one for each application. There are multiple projects under the B2B supply chain app folder, one for each environment related to continuous integration/continuous delivery: a development, staging, and production environment. Other apps in the chart would have a similar project structure. As you set up the hierarchy, you will also need to grant organizational policies. For example, Marketing might need to access the data in the supply chain system to see if inventory levels affected recent marketing campaigns. Giving Marketing viewer permissions on the supply chain production environment might be a good choice to give them the access they need. An Associate Cloud Engineer could also be tasked with enabling Application Programming Interfaces (API's) within projects during setup. Cymbal Superstore's ecommerce project requires access to Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud SQL as a database backend and you'll need to enable the APIs for those services. Setting up the cloud environment also involves granting members IAM roles to ensure that they have the right access to projects depending on their needs of their job and role at Cymbal Superstore. For example, data analysts in the Marketing department will need to have access to historic sales data in the ecommerce system. This could be a great use case for BigQuery, Google Cloud's data warehouse solution. How would we go about giving proper access? New data analysts would need to be added to the data_analyst group. Managing permissions and rules at a group level is easier than keeping track of permissions for individual users. Data analysts need to access the data in the dataset or table, so they require the bigquery.dataViewer role at the proper level. Queries in BigQuery are executed as an executable job. So to submit a query, a data analyst would also need the bigquery.jobs.create permission. This permission is included in the predefined bigquery.user role. You would give the data_analyst group access to this role in the Production project. As a cloud engineer, you'll need to know how to manage Cymbal Superstore's users and groups in Cloud Identity, a service for managing users and groups if you are not doing so via Google Workspace. Google Cloud Observability, which used to be called Google Cloud's operations suite and Stackdriver before that, provides metrics and logging services for all of your services, resources, and projects in your cloud architecture. To monitor metrics from multiple projects, you set up project scoping. If Cymbal Superstore's Operations department decides to monitor metrics across all three supply chain projects in the staging environment project, you will set staging as a scoping project and then add dev and production as monitored projects. While migrating to Google Cloud, Cymbal Superstore will be moving some of its IT expenditure to operational expenses, and different departments associated with each application will be responsible for compute and storage costs. You'll need to create a different billing account for each group and link each project to the appropriate account. The department lead in Sales and Marketing expresses particular concern about the cost of housing its data warehouse in BigQuery and how to optimize queries and storage. You'll need to set up custom billing budgets and alerts for this department. Each department will also need you to set up billing exports that can be used to track charges.

- [YouTube: Selecting resources for Cymbal Superstore’s cloud solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdxvKZq5v6w)

Let's discuss how to evaluate Cymbal Superstore's existing applications so that we can plan and configure a cloud solution for them. The first planning meeting for Cymbal Superstore's migration to Google Cloud was a success! Everyone is excited to get into the details of how Cymbal Superstore's existing applications are going to be migrated to the cloud. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you are tasked to help realize the cloud architect's design during the next phase of Cymbal Superstore's cloud migration - planning and configuring the solution. Compute options in Google Cloud include those based on virtual machines as well as those based on containers. There are also resource-based and serverless options available from a compute perspective, depending on your team's expertise and focus. The level of control or flexibility needed by your solution can also be factors in deciding the correct compute product to use in a solution. Similarly, data solutions in Google Cloud are based on the needs of the application. Throughput and latency will determine how quickly your application responds. There are some common questions to ask while you are analyzing your data needs. Are your data processing needs transactional or analytical? Do you need to query your data in a relational way? Do you want large groups of related data to be returned through a non-relational get operation? Your application's required network connectivity is another important facet of cloud solution planning. Does it require access to the internet, or do you just need to provide connectivity to internal components on your private network? Are you going to configure the connectivity of multiple application servers by load balancing incoming traffic across them? How are you going to protect your app against network or system outages? Let's take a closer look at how these considerations affect Cymbal's choices. Cymbal Superstore has three applications to migrate to Google Cloud. First, Cymbal Superstore's Sales and Marketing has an existing web application that provides an interface for customers to look at and order products. This ecommerce app is currently based on containers and needs to have global availability and low latency. Second, delivery services is becoming an important aspect of Cymbal Superstore's customer interactions. Cymbal Superstore would like to use Google Services to keep track of truck location. Logistics has a transportation management app implemented locally through a custom message broker. They would like to use Google Cloud to monitor the location of trucks for delivery status and the analysis of mileage for preventive maintenance. Third, Operations has decided to migrate their legacy supply chain application to the cloud. This is currently a virtual machine-based application based in a Linux operating system and is implemented with a LAMP stack. The application needs to be available local to Cymbal Superstore HQ. Cymbal Superstore's ecommerce application is currently implemented with containers, so you decide to use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for compute. For storage, you select Spanner to house Cymbal Superstore's ecommerce data because it allows for global availability and low latency. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you assist Cymbal Superstore's cloud architect in making these decisions and determining the appropriate configuration. Seeing as the ecommerce system is a web-based application, you will need an external http(s) load balancer. With GKE, you can do this by implementing an ingress object with a "gce" ingress class. Applying that manifest will create an external load balancer for you. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you should be familiar with this type of load balancing in Google Cloud. Let's move on to your role in planning and configuring Cymbal Superstore's next application. Logistics' transportation management system currently uses an on-premise message broker. Together with the cloud architect, you choose Pub/Sub as a solution to collect sensor data from the trucks for analysis in the cloud. You will use Cloud Run functions to pull the data from Pub/Sub and start a Dataflow pipeline. Dataflow will feed the data into Bigtable to store your sensor data. You can run federated queries in BigQuery to visualize your data in Looker. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you'll need to help configure all these resources. Monitoring and analysis of this data is done close to headquarters, so Cymbal opts for a regional VPC solution for this application. Finally, you play a role in helping configure Cymbal Superstore's third application. Cymbal Superstore's existing supply chain application is implemented using virtual machines with a Linux operating system and a common Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP development stack. After analyzing this application's needs, the cloud architect determines that the recommended cloud solution is to migrate this application to Compute Engine virtual instances. The data solution uses a Cloud SQL instance configured with a MySQL database. The recommended network access would be external https access to the region for partners and internal connectivity between the application and the backing database service.

Way to go! You've planned and configured cloud solutions for Cymbal Superstore's application requirements. It's time to think about how you can deploy and implement the resources needed to realize the company's goals. You've worked hard to make sure the resource entities and policies are set up correctly for Cymbal Superstore's cloud architecture. You've also selected cloud products for the applications Cymbal Superstore has decided to migrate to the cloud. Solution deployment is a critical part of your role. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, you're expected to have the knowledge to implement specific compute solutions, including Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run and Cloud Run functions. Understanding availability, concurrency, connectivity, and access options of these services are keys to success as you deploy them to support your needs. Solutions you implement in Google Cloud will also require data stores. Google Cloud's data solutions include products that utilize relational and no SQL data structures. There are different products that support transactional and analytical use cases. Some solutions are optimized for low latency and global availability. Properly implementing software-defined networking will ensure your application frontends are accessible, and your application backends are secured. A common devops practice is to deploy your infrastructure in a declarative way, and source control configuration files. Deploying resources through infrastructure as code reduces human error, and speeds up resource allocation. Knowing how to do this in the context of your role as an Associate Cloud Engineer is yet another tool you have at your disposal. As a review, here are Cymbal Superstore's proposed solutions. Their ecommerce solution, based on container management provided by Google Kubernetes Engine, data, provided by the globally available, horizontally scalable capabilities of Spanner, and external Application Load Balancer for user access. This use case also has a need for historical sales data to be analyzed by BigQuery, Google Cloud's modern data warehouse implementation. The transportation management cloud solution monitors Pub/Sub for incoming sensor data, triggers a Cloud Run function as new messages are posted to a specific topic, and starts a Dataflow job to transform data and save it into Bigtable. Finally, the supply chain application implements managed instance groups in Compute Engine. The backend store for this solution is Cloud SQL. Connectivity between the backend database and the Compute Engine instances is via TCP internal to the VPC. For the supply chain app, external access will be achieved via a regional HTTPS load balancer. Three ways you can interact with Google Cloud to work with and deploy services are via the Cloud console, the command line, and programmatically. Let's look at these in a little more detail. You want to implement a compute instance for the Cymbal Superstore development team to start developing code on. One of the ways you can do this is via the Google Cloud console. The screenshot shows some of the settings you'll need to specify as you create this instance: The name of the instance, the region and zone where the instance resides, the machine configuration, the boot disk, and network settings and other persistent disks you're going to attach to them. Cymbal Superstore's supply chain app needs a Cloud SQL backend. Here's an example of how you would do this via the CLI. Notice the parameters required include the name, resources, and region specified. Remember, you can access the CLI by loading the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can also use Cloud Shell, a cloud-based terminal with the gcloud CLI already installed on it. The transportation management system is using Cloud Run functions. Cloud Run functions gives you the option of deploying your function code from the local directory where it resides. Here's an example of the command to deploy a Cloud Run function with a Pub/Sub trigger from a directory on your local machine. trans_mg_function is going to be the name of the deployed function based on the logic in the directory. The runtime flag specifies the Python interpreter you want to use as you parse the function. The trigger-topic flag is the Pub/Sub topic you want to monitor. The data sent to your function includes the Pub/Sub event data and metadata.

In this module, you'll explore the scope of ensuring successful cloud operations. This involves managing the compute, storage, and networking resources as well as monitoring and logging tasks. These areas correspond to the fourth section of the Associate Cloud Engineer exam guide. We'll start by discussing your role as an Associate Cloud Engineer in managing Cymbal Superstore's cloud solutions. Next, you'll assess your skills in this area through 9 diagnostic questions. When we review the questions, identify the resources you'll want to include in your study plan.

### Video - [Managing Cymbal Superstore’s cloud solutions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/77/video/523323)

- [YouTube: Managing Cymbal Superstore’s cloud solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLJu7l-uuUo)

Now that Cymbal Superstore's cloud solutions have been deployed and implemented, your role as an Associate Cloud Engineer shifts focus to maintaining successful operations. Let's explore what that means. In deploying and implementing Cymbal Superstore's cloud architecture, you needed to know how to work with various compute, storage, and networking resources on Google Cloud. To ensure successful operations, an Associate Cloud Engineer needs the knowledge and skills to manage the resources used in an organization's cloud solutions. You also need to be able to use Google Cloud Observability for monitoring and logging. Cymbal Superstore's supply chain management app is made of up of resources implemented close to their headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is architected using Compute Engine. Managed instance groups let the application scale automatically and remain available across zonal outages. Sometimes, the instance template that that group is based on might need to be changed. Some reasons why you might want to do this include the following: Updating the operating system of your instances. Conducting A/B or canary testing of capability upgrades. Changing the disk type, or attached disks, attached to your instances. Once you do update the template, you'll need to ensure the change is propagated to all the VM instances in the group. Cymbal Superstore's ecommerce app is architected using containers deployed to GKE pods. As an Associate Cloud Engineer on the ecommerce team, you might be asked to configure and monitor external connectivity. An external http(s) load balancer is a solution that advertises a single global IP, provides content close to your end user, and forwards content to backends that are available globally. Cymbal Superstore's transportation management app uses Cloud Run functions to monitor incoming sensor data and implements a Dataflow pipeline that uses a sink to write data to Bigtable. As an Associate Cloud Engineer, it is common to provide information about the sources and sinks required by a pipeline to the data engineer responsible for developing it. You also need to know how to monitor your incoming data stream and manage your Cloud Run function instances. Let's specifically discuss how you might set up the resources required to query that data on a regular basis. What would it involve? Let's think about Cymbal Superstore's transportation management app. You can use BigQuery sql to query your Bigtable data by defining a permanent external table using the Google Cloud console or the bq command line tool. You do this by creating a table definition file, which includes the uri for the table in Bigtable, and information about the column families and the columns defined in the table. The entries for the table definition are written in JSON. Next, you create the external table reference with a bq mk command. On screen, you'll see an example of what it might look like for our Cymbal Superstore example. Then, you can submit the query using BigQuery sql.

- [YouTube: Managing access for Cymbal Superstore’s cloud solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaoVbHCvRfM)

As Cymbal Superstore uses its application on Google Cloud, an Associate Cloud Engineer plays an ongoing role in configuring and managing IAM access and service accounts. Let's explore some examples of how you might do this at Cymbal Superstore. To successfully perform the Associate Cloud Engineer role at Cymbal Superstore, you need to be able to manage Identity and Access Management, or IAM, in Google Cloud. We talked about the basics of IAM in the first module from the perspective of setting up cloud projects and accounts. Here, you'll consider skills involved in managing access. You'll also need to be familiar with service accounts and recommended practices to manage them in Google Cloud. To give you a better idea of what configuring access and security involves in practice, let's explore an example of where you might use a service account at Cymbal Superstore. Cymbal Superstore's supply chain app is built on a lamp stack using Google Compute Engineer virtual machine instances. It uses Cloud SQL as a backing data store. The app needs to talk to Cloud SQL to update inventory levels. It does this through a service account attached to the virtual machine that it runs on. Service accounts are designed to enable machine-to-machine communication for just this purpose. The first step in setting up a service account for Cymbal Superstore's supply chain app is to create the service account. Next, you assign permissions to the service account you just created. Finally, you attach that service account to a Compute Engine virtual machine. Attaching a service account allows the virtual machine and all the apps running on it to use the permissions assigned to the service account. Let's look at these steps in more detail. Go to the project you want to add the service account to. Service accounts are both identities and managed resources in Google Cloud. Select the service account link in the IAM menu of your project, then select create service account. In the dialog that comes up, name your service account and note the email address associated with it. You can also provide a description of what this service account does. Once you select create, your new service account will be added to the list of all your service accounts. Select the three ellipsis under actions for a list of all the actions you can perform on your new service account. Next, we'll use one of these choices to manage permissions for the service account. Select manage permissions under the actions dialog in the service account list. A new menu let's you pick your service account and add permissions to it. Copy your service account email address identifier. Search or browse the permissions to find the ones you need to add. In our example, we'll give our service account permissions as a Cloud SQL instance user. Finally, when you add your virtual machine instance, you have a chance to add the service account to it under the identity and API access section. This covers authorization. Authentication is another important aspect of both user accounts and service accounts that you should be familiar with as an Associate Cloud Engineer.

In this module, you'll focus on creating your individualized study plan. You'll use the notes you've been taking throughout this course to put together a study plan for each week in your Associate Cloud Engineer journey. Now that you've explored all five sections of the exam guide, consider what you've learned about your knowledge and skills through the diagnostic questions in this course. You should have a better understanding of what areas you need to focus on and what resources are available. Think about the answers to these questions: When will you take the exam? How many weeks does that give you to prepare? How many hours can you realistically spend preparing for the exam each week? How many total hours will you prepare? Be sure to leave enough time at the end of your plan to retake the diagnostic questions and the sample questions and fill in any gaps in your knowledge that may remain. Take a few minutes to think about how much time you will allocate to preparing for the exam and note your answers in the workbook. The number of weeks in your preparation journey will depend on a variety of factors, such as your prior experience with Google Cloud and how much time you have available to dedicate to studying each week. You might choose to focus on specific courses or skill badges each week, such as in this sample study plan or instead focus your weekly study on a specific topic, such as configuring VPCs. Once you have a high level idea of how many weeks you have to study and how you want to determine your weekly focus, you'll want to build out a plan with weekly goals and study activities. Use the template in your workbook to plan your study goals for each week. Consider: What exam guide sections or topic areas will you focus on? What courses or specific modules will help you learn more? What skill badges or labs will you work on for hands-on practice? What documentation links will you review? What additional resources will you use, such as sample questions? You may do some or all of these study activities each week. Let's review an example. If you've identified configuring access using IAM as a particular area you need to study, you might choose to structure your study for a week to include targeted modules from the on-demand training, a related skill badge for hands-on practice and documentation. Alternately, you might choose one week to complete an entire course and another week to focus on a skill badge. You can determine the approach that fits your existing skillset. Find the weekly study template at the end of your workbook. Duplicate the weekly template for the number of weeks in your individual preparation journey. Remember, you may need to adjust your plans based on the areas where you need to learn more. For more information about the resources we've discussed in this course, refer to your notes and the student copy of the slides.
