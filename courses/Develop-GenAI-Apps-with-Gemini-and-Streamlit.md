# [Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/978)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: text generation, applying function calls with the Python SDK and the Gemini API, and deploying a Streamlit application with Cloud Run. You will explore different ways to prompt Gemini for text generation, use Cloud Shell to test and iterate on a Streamlit application, and then package it as a Docker container deployed in Cloud Run.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

- Test Gemini prompt with cURL.
- Leverage Gemini Pro for advanced text generation tasks.
- Integrate Vertex AI Gemini API into a Streamlit application.
- Deploy a Streamlit Application with Cloud Run.
