let's begin with data exploration and preparation starting a new project is exciting but data exploration can be challenging often feel like a detective with a mountain of Clues but no clear Direction let's see how Gemini and big query can help Gemini powered tools like insights and table Explorer unlock valuable discoveries from data even for non-technical users with no coding experience insights automatically create queries from table metadata making data exploration a breeze here's how it works analyze metadata insights first scans your tables metadata like column names and descriptions to grasp the data's Essence generate queries inspired by this metadata insights then creates a list of helpful queries tailored to your tables these ready to use queries hold the key to unveil the hidden patterns explore and refine you dive into these queries and modify them as needed run and analyze you run the query analyze the results and uncover the insights cool how about table Explorer table Explorer is your visual tool to explore individual tables here's the process select Fields you can choose up to 10 fields in a table to focus on generate interactive cards table Explorer then generates interactive cards which show the most common values to give you a quick overview explore and filter you can click on values to drill down for more specific results create queries table Explorer automatically creates a query based on your actions apply you can apply the query directly or copy it to the query editor for further customization and execution think of both insights and table Explorer as tour guides of your data to help you with a cold start navigate through mountains of information and discover hidden patterns and paths amazing this also opens a door for non-technical users like B and her team equipped with the tools they often get deeper insights from the data than we do by leveraging their field expertise aside from the advantages are there any precautions I should take when using these tools excellent question remember that both tools are limited to working with single tables at a time this means for now they are not capable of performing ing complex operations such as joining multiple tables together well that's a great start the next real challenge lies in data preparation it's a timeconsuming and often tedious task that eats up over 60% of my time like many other data practitioners can't agree more big query uses Gemini to build low code visual AI augmented data preparations let's check out how it can be used for data cleaning and pipeline development for for data cleaning and transformation Gemini and big query provides two options first it automatically generates suggestions on the sidebar for tasks like filtering standardizing and fixing missing data you can directly apply the code if desired second you can direct Gemini to perform certain tasks by using natural language prompts for example ask Gemini to remove duplicate rows or convert data to a specific format how about automating a data pipeline Gemini in big query dramatically enhances ETL extract transform load it uses generative Ai and ml to Define Transformations it also ensures data quality with rule-based logic and anomaly detection plus it visualizes the data pipeline as a graph making it easy to understand the preparation process this speeds up the ETL development workflow in this demo let's see how insights and table Explorer in big query can help you explore data let's say you're curious about the order data start by clicking on the table then select insights and generate insights it might take a few minutes for big query to scan the metadata and create insights once it's done you'll have a list of query questions tailored to this table want to find out most popular menu items by quantity sold check out this automatically generated query code feel free to give it a try by clicking copy to query and then run here are the results want to rank the top three items however don't know how to code no worries just ask Gemini to do it for you type in the hashtag sign followed by a simple prompt find top three items accept the code and run it that's it you can bring the tab over to the left pane for a better view feel free to go through all these autogenerated insights explain them run them and modify them to your needs now let's check out the other tool table Explorer this one helps you dive deeper into each table let's say you're interested in the location table click on the table then select table Explorer and choose the fields you want once you save it you'll get an interactive card for each field showing the most common values if you're interested in certain values choose them and big query will automatically generate the query code for for you then you can run and modify the code as needed this is just a quick overview of the major features of insights and table Explorer feel free to explore more on your own cool can I try it myself absolutely here's a Hands-On lab for you to explore tools like insights and table Explorer hey Diane up for a quick quiz before the lab hit me with it what does insights do in big query a automatically generates queries to explore data B visualizes the relationships between tables C automatically transforms the data format or D generates interactive cards for each table H I think it's a you got it how can I use the help of Gemini in big query to write code and solve more complex tasks let's tackle that topic in the next lesson

in the previous lesson I learned how to explore and prepare data using Gemini and big query but how can it assist more complex code development like joining multiple tables think of Gemini and big query as a coding partner it aids in every step of code development and troubleshooting I found it particularly helpful recently want to hear more absolutely in terms of code development you can prompt with natural language to generate and complete code there are mult multiple ways to access code assistant the first option is to use the SQL generation tool button click the SQL generation tool button and type in your natural language prompt in the popup window you can also use natural language prompts start a line with a hashtag sign type natural language prompts directly into the query editor and press enter you may need to wait a few seconds SQL code will then be automatically generated press tab to accept the generated query note that once the query is generated you can further modify the code you know what else Gemini can do explain code I asked it about group by and SQL and it gave me a breakdown of its purpose how it works in my query the summary the result and even more examples it was like having a personal SQL tutor this would be extremely helpful I'm often hesitant to ask my colleagues for help because they're usually preoccupied and I don't want them to question my competence totally by the way how does Gemini handle troubleshooting similar to the code development you can prompt Gemini to review code optimize for better performance identify errors and debug code can Gemini help with both SQL and python in big query yes it can however please be patient with python assistance as Gemini is still learning awesome feels like I can use natural language to get anything any tips on how to prompt effectively absolutely Diane here are a few best practices for prompting Gemini in big query first Clarity is key choose Precision over ambiguity State your request clearly for example instead of prompting tell me about sales a more clear prompt is show me a breakdown of total sales by product category for the last quarter context matters provide any relevant background information to help Gemini understand your request instead of using what's the trend use what's the trend of monthly active users for our mobile app over the past year second ask direct questions ask one question at a time be concise avoid overloading Gemini with too much information third give explicit instructions explain key terms and algorithms for example sales equals the column unit price times the column quantity layout steps and the order fourth refine and iterate you may need to experiment a lot learn from feedback got it all in all practice makes perfect prompts true in this demo let's see how Gemini can be used in big query to develop transform explain debug and troubleshoot code let's say you are interested in finding orders specifically you want to find the total number of orders for each menu item start by creating a new query using the SQL generation tool with this prompt find the total number of orders for each menu item the results include menu item name price and size click generate review the generated SQL and click insert cool your query is added to the query workspace and ready to run run the query fantastic you get the results these results are helpful but notice the results aren't in any alphabetical order you can fix that using the transform feature select the query click the Gemini button select transform in the popup enter order the results as menu item ascending click generate review the transformed query and click insert and then run the query awesome your transformed query now alphabetizes the results you can also use Gemini to EXP explain queries or parts of a larger query imagine a teammate provides you with a custom query they wrote but you don't fully understand it you then select the query and click the Gemini button then you select the explain this query option super Gemini provides a detailed explanation in the chat window and you get a summary at the bottom you can also use Gemini to debug and troubleshoot your code by selecting the code and using prompts in the chat window let's say you're interested in locations and you want to know the total number of locations in each City and then find the top five cities with the highest number of locations you created this SQL code but you get an error when you run it let's troubleshoot it access the Gemini chat panel enter the first part of the prompt why am I getting this error table location must be qualified with a data set use shift enter or shift return on Mac to create a new line for the prompt copy and paste the query you want to troubleshoot into this new line and then click Send prompt excellent Gemini generates an explanation of the error suggests a fix and provides a key takeaway you use these to troubleshoot and resolve the error this is just a quick overview of the major features feel free to explore more on your own impressive I can't wait to try it out myself great here's a Hands-On lab where you can practice using Gemini and bigquery for code development up for another challenge I'm ready which prompt would you use to identify best products in coffee on Wheels a find popular products on the market B find top three products C find top three products by profit sales minus costs or D find top three products worst three trucks and top three locations C for sure a is too broad and against rule number one B does not explain the meaning of top products which can be different criteria such as sales profits and customer likes this is against rule number three of giving explicit instructions D asks multiple questions in one prompt which is against rule number two it also doesn't explain the exact meaning which is also against rule number three so C is perfect accurate and concise to ensure I'll guess I'll try all of them in the lab to see how Gemini interacts good idea I learned a lot thanks Tate for sharing one more question I'm a visual thinker so is it possible to sketch the workflow visually that's precisely what data canvas is for let's check it out in the next lesson

Gemini and big query seems powerful in code development and troubleshooting while this may sound ambitious as a visual thinker is it possible to start a data project by sketching the workflow from end to end that's data canvas a new feature in big query with data canus an Innovative tool driven by generative AI users can visualize a workflow from data search to query formulation to Insight generation with natural language let's walk through the five primary features offered by data canvas find data when you have an abundance of data identifying the most relevant information becomes the first step with data canvas you can search data with either natural language or keywords examine tables schemas details and previews and add them to the canvas as necessary generate code you can then join multiple tables formulate query code by using natural language prompts edit and run the query create insights with simple clicks you can easily visualize your results with charts and generate comprehensive summaries visualize workflow each of the above steps can be visualized as part of the workflow on data canvas you can further modify the canvas by adding new nodes tables and joins conveniently the mini map in the top right corner offers a bird's eye view of the entire canvas aiding navigation when zoomed in share and collaborate most important importantly you can share the canvas and collaborate with others you can also export it to a notebook furthermore you can export data to CSV and sheets charts to PNG files and looker Studio this is super powerful in this demo let's see how data canvas can be used to visualize and design queries let's say you want to know the total revenue generated by City sips roaming Cafe in 2024 and then want to compare this to other locations in bar chart start by accessing data canvas from Big query Studio then search for the coffee on Wheels data set select the location orders and Order items tables click join you see the tables are visually Associated now with each other but not actually joined you do however have a sample prompt to join these tables click Send input awesome a query is created review this query that joins these tables and run the query the resulting table shows orders for all locations with each menu item item price and item total this new table is helpful and you can use the data in the table to get total revenue for the location by using the query these results feature with this feature you can query the results using natural language prompts or write your own SQL enter the prompt what is the total revenue gener generated for the city sips roaming cafe location in 2024 include the location name and the total revenue in the results round the total revenue field to two decimal places and click Send input a query is generated and then you run it note that this query is running on the last nodes output not all the raw tables themselves fantastic the total revenue for City sips in 2024 is displayed with two decimal places in the results if you wanted to edit the query you could change the natural language prompt or modify the SQL code itself what if you want to compare the total revenue of this location to other locations how can you visualize this start by returning to the node for the join tables hover over the branch another node option at the bottom of the node results click query these results a new note appears good now enter the prompt what is the total revenue generated for all locations in 2024 include the location name and the total revenue in the results round the total revenue field to two decimal places click Send input the query is created and you click run notice this query is similar to the previous one but with this one you are not limiting the location name field to City's roaming Cafe so all locations are included in the results with total revenue click visualize and select the create bar chart option a simple bar chart with total revenue for each location appears however the chart has many locations included so it's hard to do the comparison you can fix this by transforming the default query with this prompt create a vertical bar chart with the total revenue generated for all locations in 2024 include the location name on the X AIS and the total revenue on the Y AIS in the results starting with the location with the highest revenue use a unique bar chart color for City's roaming cafe location and click Send input excellent the result is a comparison of the total revenue for this location with other locations with this chart we can clearly infer City sips is the lowest performing location by total revenue this is just a quick overview of the major features feel free to explore more on your own amazing can't wait to try it myself of course here's a Hands-On lab where you can practice with the major features of data canvas perfect data canvas is like a playground for data enthusiasts it's got so much potential for boosting productivity and I can't wait to explore all the ways of using it what do you think can you imagine any specific use cases where data campus could be especially helpful I'd love to hear your ideas was
