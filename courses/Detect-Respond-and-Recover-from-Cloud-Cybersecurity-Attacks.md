### Video - [SecOps and its components](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490401)

- [YouTube: SecOps and its components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3E2yBxc8g)

Operations make up the core structure of many different businesses and industries. For example, making sure a zoo runs smoothly requires an effective operations infrastructure. This can include everything from well-trained employees to fences, paths, and restrooms. All of this ensures that visitors have a positive experience. Similarly, cloud security often uses operations to make sure assets are protected. In this video, you’ll explore Security Operations, and discuss how professionals leverage different tools to enhance their security operations. Security Operations, or SecOps, is the practice of combining people, processes, and technology to effectively protect an organization's data and infrastructure. High-level goals of SecOps include detecting, preventing, and mitigating threats in real time. In cloud security, SecOps consists of several key components, including logging and monitoring, incident detection, incident response, and incident recovery. Let's review each of these components. Logging and monitoring are essential for maintaining visibility in your cloud environment. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems. By collecting, analyzing, and storing logs, security professionals can identify potential security threats, track changes, and monitor user activities. This information will enable you to detect anomalies, and take appropriate action to prevent security breaches. Incident detection is the process of identifying and addressing security threats in the cloud environment. This process includes analyzing log data, correlating events, and prioritizing incidents based on severity and potential impact. By detecting incidents promptly, security professionals can minimize the damage and prevent further escalation. Incident response is the process of identifying, investigating, and mitigating security incidents promptly and effectively. This includes assembling a response team, containing the threat, investigating the root cause, and communicating with stakeholders. A well-executed incident response plan can help mitigate the impact of a security breach and prevent future occurrences. Incident recovery is the process of restoring affected systems and data to their normal state. This is the final component of the SecOps process and may involve patching vulnerabilities, repairing damage, and implementing new security measures to prevent future incidents. Google Cloud offers a range of tools and services that can enhance your SecOps capabilities. Some of these tools include Google Cloud’s Security Command Center, or SCC; Chronicle SIEM, Chronicle SOAR, VirusTotal, and Mandiant Threat Intelligence. Let's first discuss Google Cloud’s Security Command Center, or SCC. This tool is an on-guard security specialist for all things Google Cloud. It monitors data security risks and potential threats using its dashboard and data analytics. SCC also identifies security findings, keeps an inventory of cloud assets, and even scans web applications for security threats. Next, is Chronicle's Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM. This tool provides actionable security insights in real time. Chronicle’s SIEM tool takes massive amounts of machine data and translates it into helpful security information. Chronicle also offers the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response solution, or SOAR. This tool gives teams the power to fight common threats by using automated response workflows. From managing alerts and cases, to deploying incident response playbooks, SOAR ensures security teams are able to shift from detection to response quickly. Now, let's discuss VirusTotal. This service is an online detector used to identify malicious content. Just submit files or URLs to VirusTotal and it will analyze them using various tools, like antivirus engines and website scanners. VirusTotal also uses analysis tools to detect viruses, worms, or trojans. Last is Mandiant's Threat Intelligence. This service offers more than just security updates. Mandiant’s Threat Intelligence helps security professionals understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by global threats before they occur. Actively applying this knowledge is beneficial to establishing defensive strategies, and maintaining strong SecOps. In this video, we explored the world of SecOps, its key components, and how teams leverage Google Cloud tools to enhance their security operations. By understanding and implementing these concepts, security professionals are on their way to strengthening an organization's cloud infrastructure.

### Video - [Vulnerability management techniques](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490403)

- [YouTube: Vulnerability management techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-xZA6jqsY)

Good management is the key to successful operations. In this video, you’ll explore Security Operations management. You’ll also learn key concepts like vulnerability management, red team, blue team, penetration testing, and tabletop exercises. Vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilities. Monitoring and managing vulnerabilities can minimize the risk of cyber attacks and protect valuable assets. Here’s an example. A software company ensures the security of its cloud infrastructure by using advanced automated tools to regularly scan for vulnerabilities. When discovering high-risk vulnerabilities, the company prioritizes patching to prevent potential attacks, demonstrating its commitment to safeguarding its infrastructure, and protecting users' data. In vulnerability management, the red team and blue team play crucial roles. A red team is a group of ethical hackers who mimic potential adversaries in order to examine the security defenses of an organization. As a cloud security professional, the red team can be part of your organization, or they can be part of an outside group hired to test your security. By simulating real-world cyber attacks, the red team helps your organization understand its weaknesses and improve its security posture. The blue team is a group responsible for defending the organization's systems and networks from simulated attacks. They work closely with the red team to identify vulnerabilities and implement security measures to protect your systems. The blue team focuses on monitoring, detection, incident response, and recovery to ensure your organization's security remains robust. Here’s an example. A financial institution hires a red team to simulate a cyberattack on their online banking platform. The red team identifies a vulnerability that allows them to access sensitive user data, highlighting the need for improved security measures. In response to the red team's findings, the financial institution's blue team implements additional security controls, like multifactor authentication and encryption, to protect user data from potential attacks. Organizations can also use penetration testing to manage vulnerabilities. Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Penetration tests can include exploiting weaknesses in various parts of an organization's security, like networks, applications, and even physical security measures. By conducting pen testing, organizations can better understand their risk level, and prioritize remediation efforts to strengthen their overall security posture. Imagine this scenario: A healthcare organization initiates a penetration test on their patient portal. The objective is to assess the security of patient data. The penetration test found a vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to an insecure Application Programming Interface, or API, linked to the patient portal. Despite the organization having detection protocols in place, the unauthorized access to the API went undetected. The organization realizes they've missed an opportunity to identify a security incident. As a result, the organization adds additional security measures including encryption, adjusted access controls, and more robust authentication. They also initiate a reassessment of their security event log coverage, monitoring for better incident detection and response. Finally, the organization commits to conducting frequent security audits for real-time evaluations. This case highlights the need for a robust SecOps approach to minimize potential vulnerabilities, retain data security, and repair technical loopholes. Finally, let's discuss tabletop exercises. Tabletop exercises are scenario-based exercises that involve an organization's security team and other stakeholders. During tabletop exercises, participants take part in a guided conversation centered around a scenario in a relaxed and informal setting. These exercises aim to replicate emergency security situations and are grounded in the organization's current policies, plans, and procedures. As the exercise unfolds, team members examine their roles and responses to the simulated crisis. They put their incident response plan to the test, assessing the organization's readiness. The main objectives of tabletop exercises include fostering a deeper understanding of concepts, pinpointing strengths and weaknesses, and driving changes in policies and procedures. For example, imagine a retail company conducts a tabletop exercise simulating a ransomware attack on their point-of-sale, or POS, systems. This exercise includes participants from various departments like security, store management, and IT support. The exercise uncovers gaps in the company's incident response plan, including insufficient data backup procedures, unclear roles and responsibilities, and inadequate employee training. It also highlights the need for improved communication between security teams and store management. Based on these insights, the company can proactively address these gaps by updating their incident response plan, conducting regular employee training sessions, and implementing robust data backup solutions. These changes enhance the company’s overall security posture. Security Operations management is an essential part of maintaining a strong cloud security posture. By understanding the roles of the red and blue teams, conducting penetration testing, and participating in tabletop exercises, organizations can effectively manage vulnerabilities, and protect their assets in the cloud.

As a cloud security analyst, you’re the first line of defense when a system has been compromised. That’s a very important role. In this video, we'll explore the significance of incident detection in maintaining a secure cloud environment. Incident detection is the process of identifying and addressing security threats in the cloud environment. By detecting these threats early on, you can take quick action to minimize risks and protect valuable digital assets. Within the Google Cloud ecosystem, there are powerful threat detection tools specifically designed to assist with incident detection. One of these tools is the Google Cloud Security Command Center, or SCC. SCC which can help you gain visibility into your cloud resources, and detect potential security threats. It provides insights, alerts, and recommendations to enhance incident detection and response. Another tool is Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring. This tool enables you to collect, analyze, and visualize logs and metrics from your cloud infrastructure, allowing you to identify suspicious activities and potential security incidents. Last, are the tools included in the Google Chronicle Security Operations Suite. Chronicle SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence provide security professionals with the ability to detect, respond, and analyze incidents from several different sources. Now that we’ve discussed threat detection tools, let's explore incident detection. The focus of incident detection is to spot anything out of the ordinary, like strange patterns and abnormal events. For example, this could include a user login from a new physical location. The faster you can detect these types of occurrences, the more effectively you can respond to any issues and keep your cloud systems secure. To be successful in incident detection, cloud security professionals should consider the following common questions. What are the indicators of compromise associated with this incident? What is the potential impact? What critical systems or resources are affected? Has the incident spread to other systems? Are there any indicators that an attack is still in progress? And, what evidence should be collected to help my team? By asking these questions, you’ll be able to quickly assess and triage a security incident. And, your answers to these questions can strengthen your team’s ability to respond effectively to these types of incidents. So, whether you’re starting your career in security operations or looking to specialize, mastering incident detection will improve your ability to identify, evaluate, and respond to unforeseen security events.

- [YouTube: Phases of incident response and management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpXqeKS-_xM)

In cloud security operations, incident management plays an important role in ensuring swift response to potential threats. How can you, as a cloud security professional, handle these incidents when they arise? Well, with a plan. In this video, you'll learn about the phases of the NIST incident response lifecycle, which provide a structured approach to managing security incidents in a cloud environment. The manner in which cloud security professionals manage incidents is an important part of cloud security operations. Effective incident management helps minimize the impact of security incidents, enables you to quickly identify and repair vulnerabilities, and also ensures that your organization remains compliant with regulations and industry standards. Now let’s discuss the NIST incident response lifecycle. This framework was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. It provides guidelines and best practices for a structured approach to handling security incidents. You can use this framework to guide YOUR response to security incidents. It consists of four phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and finally, post-incident activity. Now, you’ll learn how to apply the NIST incident response lifecycle to incident management. You can also follow along with a practical example within Google Cloud. The first phase of incident management is preparation. This includes everything an organization needs to do before a security incident occurs. During this initial phase, an organization develops an incident response plan, defines policies, assigns roles and responsibilities, and identifies critical assets. The second phase is detection and analysis. The goal of this phase is to identify security incidents early on by collecting and analyzing data using monitoring and logging. Detection can happen in many ways. For example, a user might report an issue, or a security monitoring solution might generate an alert. In Google Cloud, you can use tools like Security Command Center, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Chronicle SIEM, Error Reporting, and Stackdriver Trace to detect anomalies, trigger alerts, and analyze logs. With detection tools, you can configure alerting policies to notify you when a specific event happens, like an admin login from an unusual location. With analysis tools, you can also examine and analyze incidents. An important part of this detection process is examining events surrounding the alert. For example, examining any logins before the alert, and monitoring any changes, like role assignments or unusual configuration changes after the alert. During the investigation, it's also helpful to ask questions that can triage the incident. Some types of questions include how the alert was initially detected, the timing of detection, what logs are accessible, and if there are signs of ongoing unauthorized access. The third phase is containment, eradication, and recovery. After the incident has been correctly identified, any compromised systems need to be contained to limit impact. Then, the attacker’s system access must be removed and any damage they caused must be completely eradicated from the system. Recovery actions are then performed to return operations to normal, ensuring that all systems are functioning as expected. This gives the organization the opportunity to implement more precautionary measures moving forward. There are several cloud tools that you can use to enable containment, eradication, and recovery actions. This includes preventing the spread of malicious activity and minimizing data loss. By leveraging Google Cloud's capabilities, you can isolate the resources that have been affected using Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC firewalls, with the Cloud Security Scanner. Also, identity and access management, or IAM, plays a key role in the containment and removal of an attacker in cloud environments. By leveraging IAM features, you can address the security concerns identified during the Detection and Analysis phase. This includes actions like disabling compromised accounts, revoking suspicious OAuth tokens, and blocking untrustworthy IP addresses. In Google Cloud, many services work collectively to safeguard data, automate infrastructure, and ensure consistent deployments for reliable operation. These services can be used as tools to assist you in your containment, eradication, and recovery efforts. Google Cloud Sequel's automated backups consistently preserve important data, and its point-in-time recovery feature allows restoration of the database to an earlier state in case of accidental modifications. Alongside this, Deployment Manager automates the process of deploying and managing your services and resources for consistent handling of configurations, enabling automatic scaling and balancing of applications. Google Cloud Backup and DR Service is a complete disaster recovery solution safeguarding data, applications, and digital assets. It ensures system restoration post-disaster, verifies backups for readiness, and offers configurable on-demand and scheduled backups. It also includes testing and planning for quick recovery in case of system failure. It’s important to remove an attacker and isolate and restore any critical services after an attack. You also need to be careful while restoring systems to avoid the accidental reintroduction of malicious elements like backdoors, compromised accounts, or command and control —or C2— elements. These can potentially offer the attacker a chance to reestablish a presence in your system, especially if you restore the vulnerabilities that were present in the system before the initial attack. The final phase in the incident management process is post-incident activity. This phase is where you learn from the incident and identify areas of improvement. Once the threat has been successfully contained, you can perform post-incident activities such as conducting a postmortem analysis, documenting the incident, and implementing changes to prevent similar incidents in the future. Cloud tools can be used to facilitate post-incident activity. Google Cloud's Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Security Command Center's continuous monitoring and recommendations are valuable resources in understanding the actions leading to the incident and identifying improvements. Google Cloud's Cloud Audit Logs can help you understand the actions that led to the incident and identify areas for improvement. You can also use Cloud Security Command Center's continuous monitoring and recommendations to proactively improve your security posture and prevent future incidents. It’s also recommended that your organization adds more security measures, like implementing IAM Organizational Policies to enforce settings and restrictions, and strengthening network security with VPC/Firewall rules. By following these phases to guide your incident response, you can effectively detect, analyze, and resolve security incidents. This minimizes their impact on your organization's infrastructure and data. With Google Cloud's comprehensive suite of security tools, you'll be well-equipped to handle any security incident that comes your way. Knowing how to respond to an incident can boost your confidence and make you a valuable asset to your security team.

If you’ve ever planned a dinner party, you know there are a lot of steps involved. You have to invite guests, shop for ingredients, clean your home, prepare food in a timely manner, and create a welcoming environment. Having a plan in place reduces the likelihood that something can go wrong. Incident management works similarly in cloud security. In this video, we'll discuss the importance of incident management. We’ll also dive into ways to build an effective incident management plan. Let's get started. Incident management is an important part of cloud security. It helps organizations identify, analyze, and respond to security incidents in a timely and efficient way. By having an incident management plan in place, you can minimize the impact of security breaches and maintain the continuity of operations. Let's briefly reexamine the NIST incident response lifecycle. The key phases of the lifecycle are preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity. When forming an incident management plan, it's important to be thoughtful while applying each step. You should also be aware of the typical responsibilities associated with incident management. This will help ensure a comprehensive and effective approach. The first phase of an incident management plan is preparation. One way to begin preparation is to assign roles and responsibilities associated with incident management to all relevant stakeholders. Roles may include: incident reporters, who are responsible for identifying and reporting incidents to the appropriate teams; incident responders, who are responsible for analyzing and prioritizing incidents, coordinating response efforts, and implementing containment, eradication, and recovery measures; stakeholder communication executives, who are focused on ensuring transparent communication about the incident status and associated actions to all relevant parties; incident review and improvement analysts, who concentrate on conducting postmortem analyses, pinpointing areas of improvement, and refining the incident response plan post-resolution. Clear, designated roles and responsibilities ensure that there are open communication channels, improving communication between relevant points of contact. The second phase of an incident management plan is detection and analysis. A comprehensive and effective system for incident detection and analysis should include a combination of several components aimed at identifying, detecting, and managing potential security threats. Through the use of monitoring and alerting tools, security professionals detect threats to the system. They also use security tool integration to respond to threats, and report their findings. Let’s examine these components more closely. First, monitoring and alerting tools like Google Cloud Monitoring and Grafana can help identify potential security threats in real time. Next, advanced detection measures work alongside monitoring tools to recognize and validate threats. You can use this component to differentiate between normal operations and possible security threats or breaches. Next, security tool integration can help facilitate efficient real-time threat detection and response. For example, an organization's SIEM platform can be integrated with tools like Elastic Stack or AlienVault OSSIM. Finally, it’s important to establish well-structured incident reporting and escalation protocols. Tools like Sentry or Google Issue Tracker can be used to help ensure that incidents are reported and escalated to the corresponding personnel or teams. Some examples include the Security Operations Center, or SOC, and the incident response team. When combined, these components help create a robust and comprehensive system ensuring optimal incident detection and reporting. Once an incident has been detected and reported, it must be analyzed. The incident response team should gather all relevant information and determine the severity, scope, and potential impact of the incident during this step. The analysis process can be broken down into steps. First, review logs and data sources to grasp the incident's nature. Then, analyze network traffic to find patterns and vulnerabilities. Next, examine affected systems to assess damage and pinpoint exploited weaknesses. Then, collaborate with IT and security teams to gather more information and insights. After that, be sure to preserve evidence properly; it’s crucial when involving law enforcement. Finally, consider engaging professional incident responders who have expertise in chain of custody and evidence collection. The third phase of an incident management plan is containment, eradication, and recovery. After an incident has been analyzed, security professionals need to contain the attack, eradicate any malicious elements, and recover the affected systems. Containment involves stopping the attack from causing further damage, while eradication focuses on removing any malicious elements from the affected systems. During the containment and eradication portion of this phase, security professionals will: implement network segmentation or isolation to prevent the attack from spreading; remove and rehydrate any affected system, where there is no concern for data loss; and eradicate malware from systems that contain critical, useful, or important data. Once the issue is contained and eradicated, the recovery process starts. During the recovery process, security professionals will: patch vulnerabilities and update software to prevent future exploitation; restore data and applications from backups, ensuring that they're free from any malicious elements; and monitor the environment to ensure the incident has been fully resolved, and that no additional threats are present. Security professionals should also consider managing identity and access management, or IAM, which includes disabling and expiring tokens, resetting passwords, and deprivileging accounts. Also it’s important that they revoke access or disable Service Account to minimize potential risks and maintain security. After a security professional has remediated an incident, they’ll move on to the fourth phase of an incident management plan: the post-incident activity. In this phase, the security professional and their team will examine how the problem was handled to identify ways to improve their response in the future. This may involve: enabling additional tools for monitoring blind spots discovered through lessons learned; conducting a postmortem analysis to determine the root cause of the incident, and identifying any gaps in the incident response plan; updating policies, procedures, and technical controls to prevent similar incidents in the future; and providing training and awareness programs to educate employees on the latest threats and best practices for maintaining security in the cloud environment. Following our continuous learning approach, we also focus on regularly reviewing and updating the incident response plan to ensure it remains effective and aligned with the organization's needs and objectives, completing regular incident response exercises for preparedness against potential threats, and testing offline backups and restoring processes to ensure data integrity. In this video, we covered the essential steps in building an effective incident response plan. By following the steps in the phases of the NIST incident response lifecycle and continuously improving your plan, you'll be better equipped to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents in your cloud environment. Planning ahead and preparing effectively will make you better equipped to respond to a multitude of security situations.

Hi there. In this video, we’ll focus on the fundamentals of Intrusion Detection Systems. We’ll also discuss their relevance to Google Cloud and explain how these systems can strengthen your cloud infrastructure's defense against digital threats. When working as a cloud security professional, your system may not display flashing red lights or exclaim "intruder alert." But using intrusion Detection Systems, you can detect when unauthorized access is taking place. Intrusion Detection System, or IDS, platforms are crucial because they actively monitor and analyze your networks for any malicious activities or policy violations. An IDS works much like a security camera system in a bank. The security cameras monitor the physical environment for any suspicious activity. In the same way, an IDS monitors a cloud environment for any malicious activity. Without an IDS, your organization could be left vulnerable to attacks, potentially damaging your data integrity and compromising your cloud security. Cloud IDS actively uses IDS principles to enhance security by detecting network threats, managing in the cloud, having thorough security, keeping full traffic visibility, meeting customer compliance, focusing on main threats, finding disguised apps, and providing efficient performance. Let’s briefly review each one. Cloud IDS actively provides a strong defensive mechanism against a variety of exploit attempts, protecting the network from threats. By detecting network threats, Cloud IDS identifies intrusive and obstructive behavior throughout both network and application layers. Additionally, Cloud IDS identifies concealed malware hidden in various file formats and web content. By managing in the cloud, Cloud IDS allows you to manage your systems in a way that best suits your needs. For example, the user interface, or UI, offers a user-friendly and intuitive visual dashboard, enabling those with minimal technical skills the ability to manage systems easily. For those who have expertise in command-line operations, the Command Line Interface, or CLI, is an efficient option. CLI allows the user more control and precision. Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are another way to manage Cloud IDS. These are ideal for users who need their systems to interact with other software, or need to perform operations at scale. These different management options, including UIs, CIs, and APis offer flexibility to users, from those who prefer simplicity to those who want more complex, integrated operations. Having thorough security can be achieved by maintaining threat detection capabilities. Cloud IDS integrates with Palo Alto Networks' threat detection capabilities to provide a broad security range.

- [YouTube: Signature and anomaly-based detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bhGcR_j6g4)

Now, let's explore signatures. A signature is a pattern that can be associated with malicious activity. A signature actively checks packet patterns for any malicious activity using factors like IP addresses, used ports, types of protocol, and payload details. In network security, a signature database should be regularly maintained and updated. The signatures in this database are designed to identify specific patterns in network traffic that may indicate malicious activity or potential threats, just like a security camera can be set up to monitor specific objects or activities. When network traffic is analyzed, it's compared to these signatures. If there’s a match, it could indicate a potential threat. As new threats and attack techniques emerge, the signature database must be updated regularly to remain effective. Here's an example of a signature. This Python dictionary is evaluating network traffic from a specific source IP address, utilizing the TCP protocol to make requests at the destination port 80, and carrying a payload labeled as exploit_payload. Now, let’s discuss anomaly-based detection. Anomaly-based detection is an alternative to signature-based detection that involves creating a normal baseline for network activity. This baseline is then used as a standard for comparison to identify activities that aren’t part of normal network operations. This security system is like a tireless guard. It keeps a constant watch on all the network traffic, comparing it against a baseline of regular or average network activity. Now, if there's any traffic that significantly changes or moves away from the baseline, the system sends an alert. These differences can often signal an unwelcome intrusion or an irregularity in progress. So, while you’re busy with other tasks, your system remains watchful, prepared to notify you of any harmful intrusions. Here's an example of how you can detect anomalies with SQL query. SQL query is designed to model the regular behavior of a network by retrieving historical data on network traffic over a specific time period. It also groups activities based on source IP, destination port, and protocol. This query has several effects. It provides insights into the network's normal behavior, establishes a baseline for comparison, and enables the comparison of current traffic to the established norm. Running this query provides a comprehensive understanding of which source IP addresses, destination ports, and protocols are commonly used within the network, allowing better detection of any deviations or anomalies. Anomaly-based detection is an effective strategy when dealing with new or unidentified threats that may not have an identifiable signature.

- [YouTube: Logs for analysis and monitoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pNN3AUftI)

They say that knowledge is power. In this video, you'll learn about logs in Google Cloud. You’ll understand the different types of logs available and find out why log retention is important. You'll also discover how logs can be used for analysis and monitoring, and how to manage retention policies using these logs effectively. Let’s get started. To get started with logs, you need to know the four foundational terms associated with logging. First, a log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems. Second, log analysis is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Third, logging is the recording of events occurring on computer systems and networks. And fourth, log management is the process of collecting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log data. There are several ways logs can be used. For example, log analysis analyzes logs for patterns and trends to identify potential security issues. Setting up monitoring alerts based on specific log events notifies security teams of potential incidents. It’s also important for teams to regularly test the monitoring to ensure its effectiveness. Maintaining retention policies ensures logs are retained for the required duration to meet compliance and security needs. And threat detection proactively detects and mitigates security threats based on log data and analytics. Logging contributes to security monitoring and incident detection by providing valuable information about activities within systems. By analyzing logs, security teams can identify suspicious patterns, detect potential security breaches, and investigate incidents. In Google Cloud a variety of log types are generated, each serving a unique purpose. Types of logs include: admin activity audit logs, data access audit logs, system event audit logs, and policy denied audit logs. Let’s explore each of these log types in detail to help you better understand their functions and use cases. Admin activity audit logs provide a view into the activities of administrators and other authorized individuals. These logs track who did what, when, and where. Actions like creating databases, deleting instances, or changing permissions would be found here. Here’s an example of an admin activity audit log: 'admin@example.com' created a new table in Google Cloud Bigtable. The log entry shows the user performed a 'CreateTable' operation in Bigtable service. Now let’s explore data access audit logs. Data access audit logs record API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data. In other words, these logs tell when data is created, modified, and read, and by whom. Examples of these activities include Google Cloud Storage object accesses and Datastore database reads and writes. Here's an example of a data access audit log, which records a specific event. The code is a JSON representation of a data access audit log entry from Google Cloud. In this case, the event is a ReadRows operation in Google Cloud Bigtable. Next are system event audit logs. System event audit logs report changes to your system's configurations and settings. Some examples of changes to a system include alterations to the settings of a cloud service. These logs provide invaluable information that can be used to detect anomaly behaviors in systems. Here’s an example of a system event audit log. This is a JSON snippet from a Google Cloud Audit Log, which records system events for Google Cloud resources. Simply put, this log shows that a migration of a Compute Engine instance took place because of host maintenance. And finally, there are policy denied audit logs. Policy denied audit logs capture instances where requests were denied because of existing IAM policies. Unauthorized access attempts and modification requests by users without the required permissions can be found here. These logs provide a strong audit trail of any failed access requests. Here's an example of a policy denied audit log in Google Cloud. This log documents a denied attempt to start a compute instance using the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on my-project. It effectively tracks unauthorized actions for security and compliance purposes. Understanding the four crucial types of logs in Google Cloud can help manage systems and improve cloud cybersecurity. Now, let’s dive into the log lifecycle and retention. Logs follow a lifecycle that includes generation, storage, analysis, and eventual expiration. Log retention is an important part of the log lifecycle as it's used to preserve logs for a specific period to meet regulatory requirements and facilitate historical research. Retained logs can be used to investigate past incidents, identify trends, and improve security posture. With Google Cloud, users can decide how long to store their logs. Based on the needs of their organization, users can balance the cost of storage and the need for past data. Users also might choose to save their logs to cold storage or store them offline. With these options, if a security breach lasts longer than an organization’s usual log storage period, it won't lose access to vital log information. So, where are logs located in Google Cloud? Logs in Google Cloud can be found in various locations. These locations include the Logging section of the Google Cloud Console, Cloud Operations, and BigQuery. Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM systems, like Chronicle, can aggregate logs from different sources, providing a centralized platform for log analysis and security monitoring. In this video, you learned about logging and log retention, the different types of logs in Google Cloud, and how logs can be used for analysis, monitoring, and maintaining retention policies. With this knowledge, you can effectively manage and secure your cloud environment.

### Video - [Alerts and notifications](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490418)

- [YouTube: Alerts and notifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB2y9A-AQ_M)

Have you ever written a note on a piece of paper to remind yourself of an upcoming responsibility? Cloud security professionals do something similar by setting alerts and notifications within their cloud environments. In this video, we’ll go through an overview of alerts and notifications. You'll also learn about false positives and effective management strategies to efficiently handle alert systems. With these insights and strategies, you’ll be prepared to start implementing alert management systems in your Security Operations, or SecOps. Let’s get started. In cloud security, protection is the primary defense method. Alerts play an important supporting role in this process. Reliable alerts actively warn of potential issues or threats, helping security professionals identify and address problems quickly. Keep in mind that while some alerts come from security detections, others might not. But, focusing on the actual detection is more crucial than the alert itself, because it directly impacts safety. There are some common alert types to consider for a cloud environment. Let’s examine three types. First is unusual network traffic. Cloud security professionals set alerts to monitor for unexpected spikes in traffic or unauthorized access. Second is suspicious login activity. It’s helpful for cloud security professionals to configure alerts for failed login attempts or logins from unfamiliar locations. Third is policy violations. Cloud security professionals create alerts to detect when users attempt actions prohibited by their organization's security policies. It's important to note that not every alert signals an actual threat. Some alerts are just false positives. A false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat. False positives flag normal activity as potentially harmful or suspicious. False positives increase the workload of the SecOps team, which can lead to lower performance and productivity. The team may experience alert fatigue while handling an overwhelming volume of these alerts, potentially causing genuine threats to slip through unnoticed. Managing false positives effectively involves a methodical and focused approach. Here are the essential steps for managing false positives more efficiently. First, refine alert parameters by adjusting them to align with your organization's specific risk tolerance and security posture. This will enhance the overall accuracy of the system. Next, audit regularly. The task of managing false positives is an ongoing one. Regularly auditing alerts ensures system accuracy. It’s also important to collaborate across teams. Include all teams in refining, reviewing, and providing feedback. That way, each team can contribute uniquely to more effective identification and management of false positives. Also, apply feedback and utilize it as a powerful tool for continuous improvement. When used effectively, it can improve alert systems' precision and prevent alert fatigue. Next, use automation like AI and machine learning to spot false positives. This will free up your team for more challenging work. Also, make sure you prioritize training and education. Train your staff to manage false positives effectively and keep learning, so you can be aware of new threats. It’s also important to customize strategies. Given the quick evolution of threats, a fixed strategy is not enough, so it’s crucial to tailor false positive management strategies based on shifting needs and situations. And finally, to improve your organization's overall security operations, it's essential to integrate a strategic process for mitigating false positives. By strategically thinking, integrating, and adapting, this approach not only reduces alert fatigue, but also strengthens the organization's security posture and risk resilience. Google Cloud offers a comprehensive set of tools designed to assist in creating meaningful alerts. These tools allow users to define alert conditions and parameters, assign appropriate alert policies, and specify preferred notification methods. It's important to adapt this process to your system's unique needs and vulnerabilities, ensuring optimal protection and monitoring. As you manage your alert system, keep the following best practices in mind: prioritize alerts based on risk level and potential impact, make use of machine learning to identify patterns and reduce false positives, and regularly audit your alert system to ensure it remains effective. By understanding the role of alerts and notifications in cloud cybersecurity, mitigating false positives, and using Google Cloud tools to set up effective alerts, you'll be better prepared to protect your organization's cloud environment.

- [YouTube: Alert search techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o195K3A_77U)

Cloud security professionals use alerts to manage their cloud environments. In this video, you’ll explore how effectively querying alerts can handle cybersecurity threats. Ready? Let’s dive into the world of alert search techniques. Querying alerts is the act of scanning through numerous security alerts from your cloud infrastructure to identify possible threats. As a cloud security professional, these alerts provide essential information on potential weaknesses and incidents that need attention. Effective querying, or the use of precise data requests, has become a crucial part of how security issues are handled. This powerful tool reduces risk, forming a strong base for several aspects of active security management. Effective querying allows you to identify important alerts in real time, prioritize high-impact issues, streamline response to incidents, and enhance proactive security posture. Alert filters are instrumental in refining your search results. Chronicle Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, tool improves search efficiency and threat analysis by enhancing alert filters. These filters focus on specific details, like event categories, severity levels, or time frames to narrow down search results. By using Chronicle SIEM, you can streamline your security operations. Chronicle SIEM also offers refined features, like customized filtering criteria, adaptable event correlation, and machine learning-based insights to simplify data management. These functions help manage the flood of data, removing unnecessary information, and highlighting the most important alerts. Chronicle SIEM provides better alert filter performance, and stronger threat detection and analysis. Let's examine some of the most common filters that can be used in Chronicle to query alerts. The most common filters include alert title, source, destination, severity, and time. They can be combined in different ways to create highly targeted queries. When creating queries, it's important to be specific and thorough. But, being too specific may cause some results to be overlooked if they don’t match your criteria. So, let's go over some tips for querying alerts. Here are some best practices for querying alerts. Make searches specific to lessen distractions. Save your frequently used searches for future use. Familiarize yourself with the frequency and timing of alerts. And always reassess and change filters as needed. Now, let's review each of these practices. It's important to make your searches specific to lessen distractions. By focusing on key details that directly relate to the issue you're trying to identify, you can find relevant information and insights faster. This targeted approach removes unnecessary data, increases the relevance of your search results, saves time, and reduces frustration. To achieve a more efficient workflow, and maintain the same standards in data analysis, make sure to save your frequently used searches for future use. This will not only give you faster access to information, but also significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to accomplish search-related tasks. Familiarizing yourself with the frequency and timing of alerts helps you effectively use your time and resources. By understanding past patterns and changes in the amount of alerts, you can better prioritize your responsibilities. Proper prioritization helps you manage time more effectively and identify alerts that are no longer relevant. Focusing on the most significant alerts makes your work process more efficient and increases your overall productivity. And remember to always reassess and change your filters as needed. It’s important to consistently update your filters to stay aware of new risks and technological updates. Paying close attention to alerts can also help you quickly handle any unexpected issues, ensuring potential dangers are handled swiftly and successfully.

It’s great to have you here. I’m so excited to share my cloud security knowledge with you. Coming up, we’ll focus on how cloud security professionals can use detection tools and techniques to detect and respond to potential threats. Then, we’ll analyze the stages of an attack and discuss false positives. You'll use Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® to learn about the anatomy of an attack so that you can better defend against one. You'll also learn about the impact false positive alerts can have, and how to manage them. Next, you'll learn how cloud security professionals gain visibility into a cloud environment through security monitoring. And finally, you'll explore indicators of compromise and threat hunting. Are you ready to develop your detection skills? Let's get started.

### Video - [Introduction to Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain®](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490428)

- [YouTube: Introduction to Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain®](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLuv8KMoKLE)

Sometimes, examining things from a different perspective can give you insights into things you might not have noticed otherwise. In this video, we'll examine Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® framework. This framework will help you understand the anatomy of an attack, so that you can better defend against it. Ready to get started? Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® framework defines the steps of a successful cybersecurity attack. Each attack provides an opportunity for defenders to understand an attacker's mindset, strategy, and goals. Before we discuss the Cyber Kill Chain®, it’s important that you’re aware of advanced persistent threats, or APT. An advanced persistent threat is an adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise, significant resources, and achieves its objectives through multiple attack vectors. APTs are a serious threat to cloud environments. The good news is, the Cyber Kill Chain can be used to identify APT activity, and mitigate it. There are 7 steps in Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® that need to be completed in order for an attacker to successfully complete an attack. As a defender, if you're able to stop an attacker during any step of the chain, you can break it, and stop attackers in their tracks. The 7 steps of the Cyber Kill Chain® are reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Let’s explore each step in detail. In step 1, reconnaissance, the attacker focuses on gathering information. Before attackers can attack, they need to identify their targets. To do this, they collect as much information about the target as possible. Malicious actors aren't that different from criminals operating in the physical world. Each step of Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® can be compared to a scenario involving a zoo heist. In this example, the members of the zoo heist team have to take certain steps in order to successfully take rare animals from the zoo. Similarly to how a heist team member would identify the best zoo to target, malicious actors plan their attack by performing reconnaissance. This includes gathering information like employee names and job titles, email addresses, and information about the target's infrastructure, like the services or operating systems being used. After successfully performing reconnaissance, the attacker moves to step 2, weaponization. In this step, the attacker prepares their attack by using tools to create a deliverable malicious payload, like malware. Similarly, in the zoo heist example, after the heist team members pick their target zoo, they must prepare for the heist by gathering the tools they need, like gloves and bolt cutters. After an attacker successfully creates their exploits, their next step is delivery. In this step, the attacker officially launches their attack. This might be done by sending a malicious email to the target, or by performing social engineering. For a heist team member, this step is like arriving at the zoo with their tools in hand, ready to break into the zoo's locked doors. After the attacker has delivered their malicious payload, they move on to the next step, exploitation. The goal of this step is for the attacker to gain access to the target. They can do this by exploiting a software vulnerability. For members of the heist group, this step includes successfully breaking the locks of the zoo to gain access. After the attacker has successfully gained access into the target's system, the next step is installation. The goal of this step is for the attacker to maintain access to the target's system without the target knowing. They can do this by installing backdoors into the system. Backdoors allow an attacker to bypass security measures and conceal their access. For the heist team, this step includes creating a secret underground tunnel entrance connecting to the zoo, so they can continue to have access to the zoo and easily transport the stolen animals. After an attacker has successfully ensured persistent access to the target's system, they begin the command and control step. The goal of this step is for the attacker to be able to remotely control the target's system. Common command and control channels an attacker might use include web, DNS, or email protocols. The final step is actions on objectives. This is when attackers achieve their end goal. During this step, they can collect and exfiltrate data, destroy systems, or worse. In the final step of the zoo heist operation, the heist members successfully steal animals from the zoo. In both scenarios, the attacker and the heist team are able to get what they want using the Cyber Kill Chain® framework. Now you can use Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® to anticipate an attack and defend against it. Staying ready means taking as many precautions and steps to prepare as possible.

### Video - [False positive analysis](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490429)

- [YouTube: False positive analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjBhM8rNE4)

It’s not negative, it’s false positive. In this video, you’ll learn about false positives and false positive analysis. You’ll examine their impact, some common causes, and some best practices for managing them. A false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat. There are many systems and tools designed to notify you of potential dangers. These types of alerting devices appear in our everyday lives, and may include fire alarms or heart rate monitors. Consider this example. You’re a cloud security professional. You’ve configured your intrusion detection system to create an alert if it identifies a threat. One day, the alert goes off. After investigating the alert, you determine that it was generated by normal behavior, so there was no harmful impact. That’s a false positive. As a cloud security professional, it’s important to recognize false positives because they have a big impact on security operations. Specifically, incident management and attack mitigation. False positives can also negatively impact a team's confidence, effectiveness, speed, and resources. It’s important that security professionals are confident when dealing with an incident, so they can quickly respond to it while also applying the appropriate resources. Security professionals can’t do their job effectively if their efforts are spent on a harmless event. False positives also impact security professionals by creating a phenomenon called alert fatigue. Alert fatigue is the result of "all noise and no signal" in security environments. Alert fatigue happens when there are so many alerts that need to be addressed, it overwhelms a security team. Over time, too many alerts can lead a team to lower the importance of alerts in day-to-day operations, leading to actual threats being ignored or overlooked. False positive alerts can have significant consequences like wasted time, loss of resources, and increased stress levels. They can also increase exposure to attacks because real threats are being misjudged. These misjudged threats are called false negatives. Let’s explore some of the common causes of false positives in regular security operations. False positives can be created from a range of situations, like misconfigurations in tools and systems, overengineered detection strategies, or even unaccounted changes within the cloud environment. So, what can be done to reduce false positives? False positive reduction strategies include continuously testing and fine-tuning security systems, consistently monitoring logs and alerts, communicating any configuration changes, and contributing to a culture of continuous learning and improvement. By reducing false positives, you can increase the chances that your team can quickly and confidently identify genuine threats.

Security professionals are at the forefront of securing cloud operations for their organizations. In this video, we'll explore security monitoring to support you in your role in the cloud cybersecurity field. Let’s start with an overview of security monitoring. Security monitoring is a systematic process of surveilling systems to detect and handle potential security breaches or incidents. For example, security monitoring is useful for online services that people depend on and use every single day, like banking apps. A single security breach on a banking app could lead to a serious security incident like customer data theft. And a breach doesn't just leave customer data at risk, it can also cause the organization to suffer financial losses and reputational damage. Security monitoring can help mitigate security incidents. By proactively monitoring all the systems in an environment, cloud security professionals can quickly address threats before they turn into serious issues. To do this, they rely on security tools, resources from the cybersecurity community, and knowledge from the professionals on their team. Making the effort to analyze, learn, and adapt is important because security monitoring is a never-ending task which demands constant attention. New vulnerabilities and attack strategies are being identified every day, making the continuous monitoring of security systems a necessity. Alert systems and tools serve as early warning systems by delivering timely notifications about suspicious activities. This can lead to faster security response times. These notifications can also help cloud security professionals gain insight into security events, so they can act and respond efficiently. So, what tools do professionals use for security monitoring? Let’s explore some of the Google Cloud tools that can help with this. To start, Google Cloud's Security Command Center provides a centralized view of all of the assets in your Google Cloud environment, helping you identify and address potential security issues. Google Cloud’s Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows security professionals to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events. They can leverage Cloud Logging to track activities and uncover evidence of potential issues. Cloud Monitoring is a service that collects metrics, events, and other data from Google Cloud, and other applications and systems. As a security monitoring tool, it creates insights about the environment so that cloud security professionals can detect security threats early on. Chronicle is a tool that's designed to retain, analyze, and search data. Chronicle combines the features of security information and event management, or SIEM, and security orchestration, automation, and response, or SOAR. This makes it a powerful security monitoring tool that can be used to quickly detect and investigate security threats. As a SIEM tool, Chronicle collects and analyzes data to detect security threats like malware. As a SOAR tool, Chronicle can be used to automate incident response actions using playbooks. And finally, VirusTotal is a service that analyzes suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content. VirusTotal integrates with Chronicle to support security professionals in their investigations by providing threat context and reputation data relating to suspicious artifacts. These security monitoring tools can provide cloud security professionals with a robust framework to monitor their security systems, set up alerts, and streamline their incident response processes. Cloud security professionals make important contributions to the security monitoring and operations processes. By learning more about these processes, you can support your organization’s development of a more secure digital environment.

Hi, my name is Tim. I work on the Detection and Response team at Google. Our responsibility here is to defend Alphabet from being hacked. Google is a target for literally every attacker out there, from the most sophisticated nation state attackers to criminals that would look to steal, you know, money and steal information and other resources, and also, you know, kind of your run-of-the-mill vandals and run-of-the-mill folks that would just, you know, look to cause chaos and do harm. The job is very hard, but it's also very rewarding. I mean, being able to protect, you know, the information and protect all of the data that users entrust with us, billions of users entrust with us, is, at the end of the day, extremely rewarding. I studied political science and history in college, but during that time, I did work at the IT department at my university. And the reason I was able to do that was because I tinkered with computers throughout my childhood, right, so, you know, getting my first kind of XT computer, breaking it a bunch of times, having to learn to fix it, learning MS-DOS, et cetera you know, unbeknownst to me, set me up to be able to work in the IT department as a help desk operator, and then growing from there into this field now. Cloud is the present and cloud is the future. If you look in the next 10, even 15 years, everything is moving to the cloud. And I'm not just talking about infrastructure service, but I'm talking about the pillars that run the cloud and understanding the identity pillar, understanding, you know, virtualization, understanding software defined networking, all of those pillars, those are not going away. They're only increasing in stature, increasing in complexity, and increasing in importance. Cloud is a field that I would highly encourage, not just people to join, but people to learn that come from a quote-unquote traditional technical background. I think for people with a non-traditional background, when you build on your communication, when you build on your analytical thinking, those will serve you in any field that you apply yourself to. Everybody who has, you know, had to figure out how to run a schedule in their own life, always had to figure out, you know, how to juggle school and work and two jobs and whatnot, those are all skills that once you kind of zone in and name them, you've had them your whole life. All of this is achievable. For example, I'm a college dropout. I never finished college. It's not about the amount of education that you have. It's not about what you've been through in your past. It's really about the ability to learn new skills and, you know, putting yourself out there and applying yourself into this world. The world of technology is so vast and it's growing so fast. It may seem overwhelming, but really, you know, zoom in on the one or two skills you want to build at a time. Make one step forward after the next step forward, and, you know, anybody can do this.

Cloud security tools can help identify and address threats. In this video, you’ll explore how to use Google Cloud's monitoring tools to proactively monitor your security. Let’s start our investigation by examining Cloud Logging. Cloud Logging is a powerful tool that you, as a cloud security professional, can use to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on log data and events. Cloud Logging is a key component for lots of cloud security activities. You can use Cloud Logging to search for log entries while investigating potential threats. For example, imagine you're investigating a potential breach where an unauthorized individual has accessed a cloud application. You want to identify whether there are any log entries that indicate that the individual accessed any sensitive data. In this scenario, you could use Cloud Logging to query for log entries from the cloud application that the individual accessed. Along with Cloud Logging, you can use Security Command Center, or SCC, for proactive security monitoring. Let’s explore these in more detail. SCC is a security solution that helps organizations improve their security posture by detecting threats and managing risk. Cloud provides instant scalability and elasticity, which allows you to quickly expand cloud infrastructure. But, this makes keeping track of each cloud asset very challenging. From a security perspective, you can't protect what you don't know. So, keeping track of your cloud assets is essential to managing risk, maintaining your cloud security posture, and, most importantly, detecting and responding to threats. SCC provides a centralized view of all your cloud assets. They’re displayed in a full inventory, providing comprehensive visibility into your environment. This overview also provides you with a way to evaluate each asset for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or errors, so that you can address them. One of the most common cloud security issues is caused by misconfigurations. SCC can detect whether cloud assets are misconfigured and vulnerable to attack, helping you mitigate security issues. For example, imagine a media organization provides cloud-based streaming services to its users. But the organization accidentally adds a new critical server to their cloud environment that contains unreleased video content. SCC immediately alerts the security team that there’s a misconfiguration in the newly created server. The alert indicates that the server has an open firewall, allowing traffic from the internet to reach the server, which can unnecessarily expose resources to attacks from unintended sources. The organization's security team quickly remediates the issue by adding firewall rules to the server, and disabling all traffic coming from the internet. Next, let's examine a component of the Security Command Center: Event Threat Detection. Event Threat Detection is a built-in service for the Security Command Center platform. It provides continuous monitoring of a cloud environment to identify and alert you to any potential threats. Event Threat Detection works by analyzing logs from the Cloud Logging platform. It analyzes log entries using built in detection rules. These detection rules then provide security systems with instructions on identifying malicious activity. You can choose which types of detection rules you want to use based on your organization's security needs. An example of a built-in detection rule is a rule that's used to identify and block suspicious account logins. To wrap up, monitoring tools provide cloud security professionals with actionable insights about their cloud environments. So, with these tools, organizations can proactively identify and mitigate threats.

- [YouTube: Indicators of compromise (IOCS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRIF7sdhKyY)

How do you know if something in your system has been compromised? Turns out, there are methods to identify potential incidents. In this video, we'll explore a fundamental component of every incident: indicators of compromise. Indicators of compromise, or IoCs, are observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident. IoCs appear as events or signs that suggest a potential security breach has occurred in a network or system. IoCs are a lot like smoke. Smoke warns you that there might be a fire. And fire can mean danger. A potential security breach in a network or system could be a serious issue. So, early detection of IoCs is critical in mitigating threats and keeping cloud environments secure. IoCs link specific data to known malicious activities, processes, or tools. Artifacts like hash values, IP addresses, domain names, or tools can be associated with malicious activity. This is similar to how fingerprints are used to link a known criminal to criminal activity. Here's an example of an IoC. A security analyst receives an alert that a new file was created on a system. The file's hash matches a file hash of known malware. The source IP address also matches a known malicious IP address. In this example, both the file hash and the source IP address are examples of indicators of compromise. It's important to know that IoCs can appear in multiple ways, and don’t always guarantee the presence of a potential threat. As a cloud security professional, you'll likely engage with IoCs, so it's important you know the best practices for managing them. Let’s discuss the five general best practices on how to manage indicators of compromise: proactive monitoring, thorough investigations, risk assessment, timely response, and documentation. Let's start with proactive monitoring. Consistent system and network monitoring helps with the early detection of IoCs. This could include configuring and fine tuning detection rules to identify anomalies, and actively monitor the activity in a cloud environment. Next is thorough investigation. As a cloud security professional, you'll likely investigate IoCs. During an investigation, it's important that you gather all related information to an IoC. That way, you can apply context to its surrounding events to determine if it's benign or malicious. Make sure to be thorough, methodical, and avoid reaching quick conclusions during your investigation. Next is risk assessment. With risk assessment, it’s important to identify the systems and data that could be affected by the detected IoC. Make sure you understand the potential impact on your organization and prioritize your response efforts accordingly. Next is timely response. Once you've assessed the potential threat, respond quickly. Your response might include anything from patching a vulnerability to initiating an incident response process. Last is documentation. Make sure to document what IoCs you discover, along with their risk, impact, and anything else that will help you and your team. Clear documentation helps security teams share and access knowledge. It’s also a crucial practice that can help improve both future investigations and the overall incident response processes. Now that you know about best practices, let’s discuss some helpful tools you can use to manage IoCs. Google Cloud's Chronicle SIEM and VirusTotal are two solutions that can be combined to help identify and respond to IoCs. Here's how they work. Chronicle SIEM collects and analyzes event data from sources that can be used to identify IoCs. Chronicle's integration with VirusTotal then lets you investigate IoCs in more detail by providing threat context, reputation data, and information about the relationship between files, URLs, and domains. Along with Chronicle and VirusTotal, Security Command Center offers key features like security services and integrated partner tools that can help you identify and manage threats. It also provides data on potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities, allowing you to respond quickly to potential IoCs. There are a wide variety of tools in Google Cloud, as well as services from multiple providers that are designed to enhance your ability to identify, investigate, and respond to IoCs. Now that you know more about indicators of compromise you can be prepared to identify and respond to them. This enhances your ability to protect your cloud environment from potential threats.

It’s often better to take action before an incident occurs rather than responding to one after it happens. In this video, we'll explore the critical role of threat hunting in security operations. We’ll also discuss the benefits of threat hunting, and the tools that support it, with emphasis on the cloud. Let's get started. Threat hunting is a proactive method of identifying previously unknown threats within a network. Malicious actors often find entryways and pivot points in a cloud environment so they can remain undetected. Threat hunting can help you, as a cloud security professional, actively search for these types of threats in your environment. It's like being a detective in the cyber world, searching for clues and hints to identify a potential breach or attack. While there are lots of benefits of threat hunting, we'll focus on three specific benefits. First, threat hunting helps mitigate security threats. Second, threat hunting helps teams respond faster to potential threats. And third, threat hunting helps inform business objectives. Let’s explore each of these benefits in more detail. Threat hunting helps mitigate security threats by identifying issues in your organization's systems and networks, so that you can take action to prevent them from causing more damage. Threat hunting helps security teams respond faster to potential threats and make better assessments by actively analyzing network traffic for malicious content, and gathering data to investigate incidents and improve defenses. Lastly, threat hunting helps inform business objectives. This not only helps intercept possible threats, it also provides insight into the current state of an organization’s security. Organizations can utilize this knowledge to align with their business objectives, priorities, and requirements. Next, let's examine one of the most widely used threat hunting frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK. MITRE ATT&CK is a framework used to understand and approach threats. It provides security professionals with a common language to outline and understand attacks. This is done through its knowledge base of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures, also known as TTPs. TTPs are based on actual, observed security incidents from known threat actor groups. This makes MITRE ATT&CK a very valuable security tool that can be leveraged in threat hunting. Now, let's explore each aspect of TTPs in more detail. Tactics describe a malicious actor's reason for performing an action or technique. In threat hunting, tactics can be used to identify the different phases of an attack. For example, initial access is a tactic that malicious actors often use. The goal of initial access is gaining access into a system or network. This is similar to a heist operation where the heist team's goal is to find a way into their target. In this example, they do this by discovering an underground access tunnel with a padlocked door they can use to access the zoo. Techniques build on top of tactics by describing the specific actions a malicious actor used to accomplish their goal. For example, malicious actors can exploit unknown weaknesses in public-facing applications to gain initial access into a cloud environment. Weaknesses could be anything that is overlooked or undetected in an organization, like a zero-day vulnerability or a misconfiguration. This is like a heist team planning to use the underground tunnel to access the zoo and finding a tool that provides initial access through the padlocked door. Finally, procedures are the specific implementation of a technique. For example, a procedure can be the specific system or application vulnerability an attacker uses to gain access to a network, like a SQL injection. This is like a heist team using a bolt cutter to open the lock in the underground access tunnel which allows them access to the zoo. Understanding the different TTPs that malicious actors use in their attacks can help you map a threat hunting campaign. One approach to threat hunting is to take the perspective of an adversary. You can do this by identifying potential attack paths and focusing on specific indicators of compromise associated with the attack path. MITRE ATT&CK is one of many tools that can be used in threat hunting. Threat hunting can use a combination of different tools to search for threats in an organization. Let's explore some other tools you can use. Tools like Chronicle SIEM can be used to hunt for threats and automatically add more context to alerts so that you can better understand and respond to them. For example, MITRE ATT&CK is one of the frameworks you can apply to threat hunting along with Chronicle. Chronicle's MITRE ATT&CK mapping capability helps you understand, prioritize, and improve defensive capabilities. This can be achieved by mapping your organization's security controls against MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques to uncover potential gaps in your defenses. There are many threat hunting tools available for security teams to use. Threat hunting tools offer benefits in many ways such as through automated detection, which leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect malicious activities, reducing the time and effort spent on manual investigation. Threat hunting tools also use alert prioritization to prioritize alerts based on severity, enabling you to deal with critical threats quickly. Pattern recognition is used to analyze patterns in data that may indicate a cyberattack, even if the pattern is subtle or complex. With historical analysis, threat hunting tools analyze past activity, which can reveal threats that have been latent or overlooked. That's a wrap on the basics of threat hunting. Remember, in cybersecurity, staying proactive is key and threat hunting is an important part of that proactive approach.

### Video - [Aggregations and correlations](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490442)

- [YouTube: Aggregations and correlations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9gVvTHpSDE)

To stay ahead of potential threats and quickly respond to security incidents, organizations need a way to collect vast amounts of data from their infrastructure. In this video, you’ll learn about the power of aggregation and correlation. These concepts can help organizations monitor activities, identify patterns, and detect potential threats. Let’s dive in. An organization can have many data points in their cloud environments, leading to lots of log data generated by user activities, authentication attempts, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems. All of this data is important to analyze when detecting and managing incidents. So the data needs to be properly gathered and consolidated. That’s where aggregation comes in. Aggregation is the process of collecting and consolidating diverse forms of data. Aggregation is kind of like farming vegetables. Farmers go through several stages to produce their crops, including plowing land, planting seeds, and watering crops. Farmers plant many different types of vegetables, like tomatoes, corn, or lettuce on different sections of their land. Once the vegetables are full grown, it's time to harvest them. During a harvest, all of the different vegetables are gathered or aggregated to a central location. Then, they’re sent to a processing facility to be sorted. During processing, any damaged or rotten vegetables are removed. After they've been sorted, the vegetables are thoroughly washed to remove soil or bugs. The harvested vegetables are then distributed to grocery stores and purchased by consumers. Just like farmers harvest and process different types of vegetables, in cybersecurity, organizations aggregate data from multiple sources in an environment. By aggregating data like logs and alerts, cloud security professionals can access relevant security data, identify patterns, and gain a comprehensive view of an environment. You might remember that a security event and information management, or SIEM tool, collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. Google Cloud's Chronicle is an example of a SIEM tool that aggregates data from a variety of sources, like logs from firewalls and data loss prevention tools. Aggregation collects massive volumes of data. So, how do organizations make sense of it all? This can be done through correlation. Correlation is the relationship between two or more security events. It involves comparing security events, adding context, and making connections between the events. Normalization involves the processing of raw data for consistent formatting. Normalized events improve the performance of correlation. Remember the farming example? Imagine the farmer has plowed the land, planted the fields, and watered the crops. But, when it comes time to harvest, the land is very dry and the farmer finds that the harvest has produced significantly less vegetables compared to previous years. The farmer makes the connection that an extreme drought must have affected the crops, resulting in fewer vegetables. Just like the farmer correlated low harvest yields with drought, in cybersecurity, correlation is used to draw connections between security events. Correlation can be used to address suspicious login attempts. For example, imagine a user logs into an account using a new device, triggering a security alert. The alert then flags the login as suspicious because the user has never logged into their account on this device before. Correlation can be used to cross reference other relevant data points related to the alert, like the user's commonly used IP address, the date and time of the login, and the user's past login behavior. If the IP address used to log into the device matches the user's IP address, the login was made during regular business hours, and is consistent with the user's login behavior, then the login can be categorized as legitimate instead of a possible breach. Now that you know how to use aggregation and correlation to access data and identify patterns in security events, you can detect and respond to threats more effectively.

### Video - [Introduction to query tools](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/969/video/490443)

- [YouTube: Introduction to query tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WluYNE-kvtc)

Being able to sort through large amounts of information is a highly useful skill in cybersecurity. In this video, you'll learn how to sift through aggregated data to find important information. That way, you can support data analysis during the investigation of a potential security threat. Let’s begin by learning how to query effectively. When working with logging systems in a cloud environment, you'll likely encounter large amounts of log data from multiple sources. Knowing how to effectively query log data can help you filter, sort, and manipulate log data to find specific information. There are lots of powerful query tools that can be used to do this. One common method is regular expression, or RegEx, which is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern. Regular expressions use these characters to search text and match specific patterns. Patterns define the parameters of a search. If a piece of text matches a given pattern, RegEx retrieves it for you. When analyzing logs in cloud environments, you can use RegEx to search through log data and extract any relevant information you need. For example, imagine you’re given an authentication log with thousands of lines of events, and need to find out if there were any failed SSH login attempts. You can use RegEx to specifically search only for entries containing the SSH protocol and port number, along with any failed login attempts. Let’s check out an example from a Google Cloud Logs Explorer search. Here's a regular expression query that matches SSH log entries. Let's examine each element. The first field, logName, identifies the log file the log entry belongs to. The equal sign and tilde is an operator that tells the application to query using regular expressions. For this example, it's Logs Explorer. Here is where the RegEx begins. The quotations are used in RegEx syntax to match a specific string. In this example, the quotations enclose the string ssh. The caret symbol is used in RegEx to match the beginning of a string. This means it will only find log entries that start with the string ssh. There are lots of different implementations of RegEx available in programming languages, applications, and tools. For example, with Google Cloud's Logs Explorer, you can use regular expressions to build queries to search through log entries. Searching with regular expressions has lots of advantages, like increased search performance compared to a regular text query. Because of its wide usage across different applications and programming languages, RegEx syntax can vary depending on the implementation. But, what's important to know is the core set of features used to match patterns in text. Let's examine some RegEx fundamentals. Square brackets are used to match a range of characters. For example, the brackets here enclose the characters abc. This means, RegEx will match any of the characters defined in the brackets. Similar to a wildcard, periods are used to match any single character. In this example, d.g will substitute the period for any other character. It will return match results for text like dig, dog, and dug. \s matches any whitespace character like a space or tab. In this example, \s is between small and coffee. This means RegEx will only match for text that has a space or tab between the words small and coffee. \d matches any digit from 0 to 9. This example begins with a caret symbol, then \d. This will match a string that starts with a digit. The curly brackets contain the number of digits you want to match, which in this case, is 5 digits. As you learn more about regular expressions, you'll be able to use these fundamentals in more complex ways to help you find the information you need. In Google Cloud's Chronicle, YARA-L is a computer language used to create detection rules for searching through ingested log data. The first field rule provides the rule name DifferentCityLogin. The meta section provides additional information about the rule. Under the meta section, there's events, which specify the UDM events that the rule needs to match on. In this case, the rule is looking for three things: user logins, users, and cities. The next section, match, specifies what must be met for the rule to match. In this case, it's user over 5m, which means the rule tries to identify a user who has logged in within a five minute period and ignores all login events that exceed 5 minutes. Finally, the condition specifies the conditions that must be met for the rule to generate an alert. In this case, the rule is looking for UDM events that match what's defined in the match section, and that have more than one city value. So, this rule will match if a user logs in from more than one city in a five minute period. If all conditions defined in this YARA-L rule are met, an alert will be generated. In the YARA-L rule you just examined, you might remember the use of UDM event types. Chronicle formats aggregated data using unified data model, or UDM. UDM is a data model used to process and store data. UDM is kind of like a filing cabinet that's used to organize files or, in this case, aggregated log data. Just like a filing cabinet uses clear labeling to identify the contents of a file, UDM organizes data and attaches UDM fields to it to represent important data points. This makes data easier to search through, and helps security professionals identify potential threats. With Chronicle, you can perform a UDM search. Through a UDM search, Chronicle searches security data that’s been ingested and formatted in UDM. With time and practice, you can learn how to effectively use these querying tools throughout your career. And as an added bonus, you'll be able save lots of time in log analysis by crafting effective queries.

In this video, you'll learn the importance of preserving evidence in cybersecurity investigations. You'll also learn about evidence preservation, the types of digital evidence you may encounter, the chain of custody, best practices, and how Google Cloud tools can support you. You can think of yourself a bit like a detective on an investigation. Let's explore these exciting concepts together. Imagine the frustration of finding critical evidence of threat actor activity that is unusable due to improper handling or corruption. Evidence preservation is crucial. It allows cybersecurity professionals to ensure that impacted systems have integrity, and that evidence is available for a follow-on investigation or to analyze how the incident occurred. That's why it's so important to preserve critical evidence in your work as a cybersecurity professional. You might encounter several types of digital evidence in cybersecurity incidents. Some examples include: IP addresses, malware, logs, file hashes, and bad behavior. This type of evidence is also known as an indicator of compromise, or IoC for short. As the term suggests, this type of information indicates or provides clues that a system has been compromised. Each evidence type can provide valuable insights into the incident. As a cybersecurity professional, this digital evidence helps you understand what happened, how it happened, and who might be responsible. It's like piecing together a digital puzzle. Now that you know more about evidence, start to think about what to do with it. How do teams keep their systems from being compromised further while maintaining integrity of the evidence along the way? How do teams work to preserve evidence during an incident investigation lifecycle? As an incident investigation progresses and more people get involved in the process, it’s important that everyone maintains the same level of care and integrity so the team can preserve the evidence. During an incident, it's important that everyone follows the same rules in the chain of custody. The chain of custody refers to the process of documenting and preserving evidence in a way that maintains its integrity and establishes a clear timeline for handling. An accurate chain of custody ensures your evidence is reliable and useful in any current or future investigation. To maintain the chain of custody, you should carefully and intentionally document each step of evidence handling from collection to storage and you should keep all documentation and evidence in a secure location. What should you think about when preserving evidence? There are three important things to consider. You need to capture and store data securely, aim to analyze evidence without altering it, and collaborate to maintain best practices. And the good news is that there are tools that can help. Google Cloud offers several tools and services to support your evidence-preservation efforts. Some of these tools include Cloud Storage, which you can use for secure and resilient data storage; Google Backup and Disaster Recovery, which is helpful for storage and recovery; and Google Workspace, which supports documentation, collaboration, and secure file sharing. These tools can help you maintain the integrity of your digital evidence and streamline your investigation process. As a cybersecurity professional, incident investigations are a key part of the job. Preserving the integrity of evidence for cybersecurity incident investigations is a critical area of focus for you, your team, and your organization. You can use Google Cloud tools to support this process and help you successfully undertake your cybersecurity investigations.

An IP address here, authentication attempts there, packets everywhere. It’s all evidence in an incident investigation, and all that evidence needs to be preserved. In this video, you’ll learn how to preserve evidence and what to consider during the process. Security teams must preserve evidence for accurate investigations and legal compliance. Preserved evidence must be undamaged, unaltered, and documented. Preserving evidence is a team effort. For it to be successful, all team members must recognize the value of evidence preservation and follow the chain of custody. The chain of custody is the process of keeping track of evidence as it progresses through an investigation. As part of the chain of custody, there are mandatory rules and processes. These rules and processes address issues such as unauthorized access and evidence tampering. When following the chain of custody, records and documentation are essential. Clear, accurate, and complete records of an incident investigation helps maintain the integrity of the evidence, ensuring that evidence is admissible and reliable. Organizations can then use that evidence to meet legal, insurance, or regulatory requirements. Proper documentation and collection of evidence helps organizations limit damage, prevent further losses, and comply with regulations. Now that you understand the importance of evidence preservation and how the chain of custody supports it, let's discuss some of the legal and ethical aspects to consider when handling evidence. As a cybersecurity professional, there are four key legal and ethical best practices. First, be aware of legal and ethical requirements. Second, balance the need for evidence with privacy rights. Third, collect only what's necessary. And fourth, destroy evidence when no longer needed. So far, we’ve covered two topics that are important throughout the incident investigation life cycle: evidence preservation, and legal and ethical considerations. Now, let’s discuss the incident lifecycle and how evidence preservation fits in. Investigating incidents involves three phases: identification, incident control, and iterate improvement. In each of these phases, preserving evidence is one of the most important principles to focus on. The first phase, identification, is the phase that new cybersecurity professionals interact with the most. The goal of identification is to provide a foundation of evidence that the team can build from and not have to go back and repair. When identifying and defining the incident in the identification phase, you'll address questions like: What logs, alerts, or events have I observed that make up this incident? What detection rules were triggered? And how can I be sure this is a true incident and not a false positive? Now let’s discuss the unique challenges for evidence preservation when working in the cloud. Cloud resources like virtual machines or containers can be short-lived and automatically scaled. Because of this, you need to collect evidence promptly and create snapshots before any changes occur. Examples of this evidence include virtual machine logs or container operating system logs. When preserving evidence, it’s crucial to enforce strict access control management and encryption policies for data at rest and in transit. Logs from any system or device in the cloud are critical. Logs help you preserve integrity and restrict access to collected evidence. Finally, let’s discuss a couple tools and services in Google Cloud that you can use for evidence preservation. Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring are often used for evidence collection and analysis. These tools help collect, store, and analyze log data from a wide range of sources, allowing you to identify and investigate security incidents. Cloud Storage also supports evidence preservation. In Cloud Storage, identity and access management provides appropriate access controls to secure evidence storage. Once evidence is stored, cloud cybersecurity professionals can use features like object versioning and storage bucket policies to ensure data integrity and secure access. Google Backup and Disaster Recovery are designed to create regular, incremental, and secure backups for everything you need in an investigation. The opportunity for evidence preservation is built right into the design of the tool. In this video, you learned the steps involved in preserving and documenting evidence and the legal and ethical considerations to be aware of. You also learned about the incident investigation life cycle and the tools you can use along the way. Now you know how to handle evidence like a pro.

How you respond to an incident will depend significantly on your preparedness. And along with good preparation, using security tools helps you respond to incidents quickly and effectively. In this video, we’ll explore how to apply an incident response process. We’ll also discuss incident cases and their lifecycle using Google Cloud for context. We'll focus on SOAR and SIEM tools to streamline the incident response workflow. Let’s start with some definitions. Security orchestration, automation, and response or SOAR is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events. Security information and event management or SIEM is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. Now that you know what the SOAR and SIEM tools are, let’s discuss how they’re used and what a typical incident response process is like. The incident response process has 3 phases. The first phase is identification. In this phase, you start an incident report because potential vulnerabilities and incidents have been identified. The SIEM and SOAR tools are very helpful in this phase. They provide valuable information about alerts and events that have already happened, highlighting indicators that the asset may have been compromised. For example, SIEM tools collect information from sources in your network. Then, the tools use a set of rules to detect and understand the information so it can be presented to security analysts. Now that the incident has been identified, it’s time to move on to the second phase: incident control. There’s a lot that happens in this second phase. The main idea is to control the incident’s impact. First, you should coordinate with your team and then resolve the issue. While the incident is being controlled, you coordinate and communicate with the rest of the security operations team. You want to make sure that everyone understands what's been discovered, and its impact. Next, you work to resolve the incident, limit ongoing damage, fix the underlying issues, and restore normal operations. Additionally, in the identification and incident control phases, the SOAR tools are useful for other aspects of incident response. SOAR programs coordinate communication between team members, assigns tasks, and track progress as teams communicate and work to resolve the incident. Now that the incident has been identified and controlled, it’s time to iterate improvement. This is the phase in which you improve your security practices by learning from what caused this incident to occur. This enables your organization to improve processes, make plans for continuous improvement, and prevent a similar incident in the future. These steps are critical for security operations teams to evolve and adapt to the changing security landscape. Let’s discuss some specific examples to learn more about the incident response process. It’s not uncommon for an organization to receive numerous security alerts every day. If cloud cybersecurity teams were to investigate these alerts manually, it would take a lot of time and effort to connect information, and determine if the team should act or not. When using a SOAR program like Google’s Chronicle SOAR, workflows are automated, and alerts are automatically analyzed, so there can be an appropriate response. For example, a SOAR program notifies your team about events connected to a phishing campaign. Your team now has the opportunity to get insight into the attack, learn from it, and mitigate similar attacks in the future. A second example is a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack. In a DDoS attack, your team uses SOAR to collaborate in real time to share information about impacted systems, attack patterns, and mitigation strategies. You use that information to coordinate with your team, assign tasks, and enable the team to quickly contain and mitigate the DDoS attack. In this video, you learned the processes and tools involved in responding to incidents. You also learned how a SOAR solution can be used during the response process. With these processes and tools at the ready, you’ll be able to respond to events and help your team manage incident response.

Imagine there’s a security breach at your organization, and you’re working on the incident response process. It’s your responsibility to help your team better understand the severity, impact, and scope of the breach. How do you accomplish that task? In this video, we’ll dive into incident identification, a critical part of any incident response process. You’ll learn how to triage and prioritize alerts, collect information, assess potential impact, and learn the difference between true incidents and false positives. To start, let’s consider incident identification. Incident identification involves recognizing potential security threats based on alerts, log data, and other indicators. The key to successful incident identification is to efficiently triage, prioritize, and assess alerts. That way, you can make sure you're addressing the most important incidents first. The initial steps in incident identification are to triage and prioritize alerts. Triaging alerts means categorizing and filtering the alerts based on specific criteria. Prioritizing alerts means you address the most critical issues first, ensuring a timely response to potential threats. When you prioritize alerts, you need to consider questions that help you focus on severity, potential impact, and urgency. For example, a question to help you consider severity might be: How serious is the potential security threat? Next, to consider potential impact, you might ask, What are potential consequences of the incident? And finally, to consider urgency, you might ask, How quickly does the incident need to be addressed? Once you've triaged and prioritized alerts, you get ready to assess the alert by gathering information and evidence related to the potential incident. This might include reviewing logs, analyzing network traffic, or examining user activity. Once you collect this information, you can assess the potential impact and scope of the incident. The assess step in incident identification will help you determine the right course of action for addressing the incident. It's important to keep in mind that not all alerts indicate a real security issue. Sometimes, harmless events like network disruptions or misconfigurations can trigger false alarms. You need to be aware of the difference between true incidents and false positives. To differentiate true incidents from false positives, you need to examine the data and confirm the type of event. Let’s discuss how to tell the difference. When distinguishing between the two, you can address the information available with analysis and verification. First is analysis. During analysis, you’ll examine the available evidence and context, review for patterns and relationships between data points, and assess whether the alert represents a real security threat. If you discover multiple related alerts and indicators of compromise, your analysis most likely indicates a true incident. Second is verification. During verification, you’ll double-check the affected systems for signs of compromise, like unauthorized access or changes to files. If you find evidence of intrusion, the verification likely indicates a true incident. If you don't find evidence of intrusion, the alert might be a false positive. Here’s a pro tip about analysis and verification in relation to false positives. Sometimes, an incident may be flagged as a false positive —and discarded based on the team’s current understanding— only to be revealed as a true positive once more information is available. You and your team will always be learning, even in an active investigation. Now you can go into an investigation with confidence. You know how to identify and prioritize alerts to help define the impact and scope of the incident. You also know how to differentiate between a true incident and a false positive to help guide your team down the right path.

- [YouTube: Coordination for incident response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA1zwrQkCEg)

Ready to explore some key concepts that will help you in your journey as a cloud security professional? In this video, you'll learn more about effective coordination and communication in incident response, and how these practices will help you keep cloud data safe. What exactly is an incident response process? It's a series of events in cloud security operations in which everyone knows their role and responsibilities, and does their part to make the response process a success. An effective incident response process is essential because it helps organizations reduce potential harm, and keep their operations running smoothly. In incident response, you prepare for potential incidents, detect and analyze them when they occur, and take appropriate actions to minimize the damage. During an incident response process, effective coordination often determines if the response is successful or not. When you've got effective coordination, you and your team work towards the following goals. You manage resources so that all systems and people are communicating effectively. You streamline communication so that everyone knows where they are in the incident response process, and what they are responsible for. And you ensure a timely response to security incidents, so that everyone knows what’s happening now and what to do next. Effective coordination is all about bringing everyone together to work in harmony. That means everyone knows what to do and how to do it. So, what are the must-have tasks for incident coordination? First, you need to set clear goals and objectives. Next, you need to define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone knows what to do. After that, you establish communication channels, ensuring everyone can stay connected and share information when needed. Then, you track progress to ensure the team is moving forward. And last but not least, it’s important to keep stakeholders informed. This is vital for maintaining trust and transparency throughout the process. When all these tasks come together, you'll have a high-performance team that’s working together and ready to tackle security incidents. To effectively address security incidents, you also need the right team members on your security operations team. Let’s discuss some of those roles. The Incident Manager oversees the entire process. The Lead Investigator implements response measures and analyzes the incident documentation and evidence to determine what caused the incident. The Communication Lead clearly communicates the progress and resolution of security incidents externally and internally. And finally, the Technical Specialists are experts in network security, malware analysis, or cloud infrastructure. These team members make sure the incident is understood and resolved. All of these roles on the security operations team work together to protect your organization's data and ensure that security incidents are handled effectively and efficiently. And to get that done, communication is key. Clear, effective, and concise communication is essential to incident coordination. High-quality communication ensures everyone understands their roles and responsibilities, and keeps stakeholders informed. In incident coordination, high-quality communication uses standardized terminology, provides regular updates, and leverages secure communication channels. These practices help avoid misunderstandings, keep everyone focused on the incident, and lead to more successful incident responses. You’ve successfully explored coordination and communication in cloud security incident identification. By implementing an effective incident response process and focusing on strong coordination and communication, you can help keep your organization's data on Google Cloud safe and secure. So go out there and use the power of coordination and communication to solve the security incidents that come your way.

- [YouTube: Documentation fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd8PGwKcMA0)

Documentation is critical to the quality of cloud security for any organization. In a security context, key documentation includes precise and accurate incident reports, evidence logs, and action plans. These documents are foundational to the cybersecurity integrity of organizations across all industries. In this video, you’ll learn the fundamentals of documentation so you can be prepared for your role as a security professional. Documentation provides insight into what has happened in the past, direction on what to do now, and what should be done in the future. Well-documented incidents serve as teaching tools for future events that enable you and your team to improve processes, playbooks, and security posture to adapt to increasing threats. There are a few types of security documentation you’ll learn more about shortly. These include incident reports, evidence logs, action plans, playbooks, and logbooks. Security operations teams commonly record evidence in these documents. As a security professional, you’ll find common types of information in the documents you'll encounter. Similar types of information might include system events, timestamps, conversations, and changes observed during the incident investigation. And in high-quality documentation, the information is accurate, clear, consistent, and timely. Documentation is also essential for preserving evidence for the purposes of legal investigation. Information like file access and integrity, chain of custody, and actions taken are all critical to maintaining the integrity of the evidence. In the example of digital forensics, files are very easy to change. To maintain the integrity of files so they can be used in legal proceedings, evidence handlers must carefully document the details of the file including how it was created, how it was secured, when it was transferred to law enforcement, and more. Preservation of evidence is also critical when the incident documentation includes sensitive information like system vulnerabilities, recent security breaches, and users with elevated privileges. All of your documented evidence needs to be preserved. The quality and integrity of your documentation will determine whether or not it can be used in the incident investigation. As a security professional, Google Cloud is a useful tool for preserving evidence. Google Cloud provides secure evidence storage solutions that depend on proper authorization and access privileges. BigQuery and Chronicle SIEM use secure identity and access management to ensure evidence preservation. Whether they're large datasets that need to be analyzed or logs that need to be aggregated and correlated, that evidence is preserved within those platforms. In addition to preserving documentation, teams use documentation to help guide their operations. A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. By using secured services and tools that work alongside the well-defined procedures and processes in playbooks, security teams improve the likelihood for success when responding to incidents. Now, let's explore those tools in an example. Imagine you’re investigating unauthorized access to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. First, you create an incident report with the initial events, their timestamps, and all impacted systems. Next, you document the evidence, including logs from Cloud Logging, and store them securely. Finally, you put a plan into action to mitigate the incident's impact, ensuring that the team has access to your findings. Throughout the investigation, you communicate with your team along the way. By applying this best practice, you ensure that everyone is aware of what’s happening and can act quickly. By understanding and applying the fundamentals of documentation in an incident investigation, and using tools to help secure and preserve your documentation, you will set up your team for success.

- [YouTube: Elements of successful documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbSuv-Bv8A)

In cloud security, recording your findings is just as important as actually responding to an issue or incident. When you document and communicate your findings, you help others understand the security situation. In this video, you’ll learn more about documentation fundamentals, the important elements of documents, and useful information to include. You’ll also consider a few tips to help you write clear and impactful documents. Impactful documentation plays a huge role in incident management and investigation. Documentation helps to improve communication with your team, encourages accurate decision-making, and supports the continuous improvement of your organization. To have impact, documentation must be accurate, clear, consistent, and timely. Documentation with these qualities is foundational to the incident management process. Although documentation can take many forms, there are specific elements that help security operations teams respond to incidents. Those elements are incident summaries, timelines, technical findings, actions taken, lessons learned, and recommendations for improvement. Not every document has all of these elements, but security operations teams do consider all of these elements during the incident response and management process. Now, let’s review each element and uncover why they’re a part of the incident response process. The incident summary is where you include a quick overview of the incident, including information about how the incident occurred, its severity, and any other relevant context. The incident summary exists so a security operations professional can quickly learn the highlights of an incident and focus on what’s important. After the summary in a document, there’s typically a section with details about the evidence that prompted the incident response process. This detailed information provides context and understanding of why the incident occurred. This information includes a timeline of events and any technical findings. Examples of technical findings include information such as misconfigurations of cloud settings; evidence of impact, like security logs, system logs, or artifacts; and evidence of a security breach, also known as indicators of compromise. After the timeline and technical findings have been presented, the next documentation element typically describes the team’s actions. This is an opportunity for the team to document what they did to mitigate the damage caused by the incident, and provide lessons learned for the future. When describing the team’s actions, pre-defined processes or automated responses, also known as playbooks, are included in the document. Incident documentation typically ends with lessons learned from the security incident, and what should be done so it doesn’t happen again. To document lessons learned, the team would have reviewed the incident to understand and record what went well and what caused the incident. Then, based on their review, the team suggests actions to take that will lead to future improvements. Now that you understand documentation elements, here are some tips to keep in mind when you work on incident response documentation. You should provide actionable information. To do that, use clear, concise, and objective language. By writing objectively and using unbiased information, you can ensure the documentation is an accurate resource for the team. Another tip is to maintain a consistent format and structure across all documents. This ensures the documents are easier for all team members to understand. When working through an incident, it’s important to encourage collaboration and communication with your team. You should use consistent language, set clear expectations, and communicate in secure collaboration spaces. And finally, you need to store information in a secure location. This ensures the integrity of your documentation. With these documentation elements and best practices, you’ll be well on your way to creating comprehensive and impactful documentation for your security operations incident investigations.

- [YouTube: Actionable alert identification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cHd69BI_d0)

How do you know when you need to respond to a potential security incident? In this video, we'll explore how cloud security professionals identify actionable alerts. The incident response process has three steps. Actionable alerts start this process in the identification step. In this step, you begin to understand what event has occurred. Keep in mind that events happen whenever there’s an observed change in normal operations. Alerts are notifications of the change. Actionable alerts can turn into incidents based on what happens in the event. As a refresher, an incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. As a cybersecurity professional, it's important to be aware that an incident is something that negatively impacts an organization's normal operations and requires a response. Consider this scenario. Failed login events in Cloud Identity software happen frequently and are a normal occurrence, so they may not trigger alerts. There are also abnormal failed login events that do trigger alerts, because someone tries logging in multiple times. For example, this may happen after returning from a vacation. This is an alert that you note, but it requires no action. One day, you’re alerted that a user has a large number of failed login attempts in a short period of time, during their workday, from an unfamiliar IP address. This has become an actionable alert that requires you to respond by initiating the incident response process. To help with incident response, security tools provide quick insight into actionable alerts. These tools scan for vulnerabilities and emerging threats, and alert accordingly. For example, say you’re alerted when there’s a high volume of traffic on the network. It becomes an actionable alert or incident when the traffic is coming from protected data storage from an unauthorized user. You know this is an incident because there is a trigger for the protected data storage and another trigger for unauthorized users. Metrics offer great insight into the happenings of a cloud environment. They can be used to measure the what and how of an event related to an alert, enabling you to quickly identify the issue. For example, say you need to know if there is high CPU usage outside of regular business hours. You can use metrics to identify the what of the alert, which is the CPU usage, and the how of the alert, which is high activity outside of business hours. Let’s introduce three Google Cloud tools and services to help with managing events, threat detection, and alerts. First, the Security Command Center. The Security Command Center is a security posture and risk management platform that gives insight into configuration vulnerabilities and incoming threats. Second, Cloud Logging. Cloud Logging is a Google Cloud-managed platform that allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events. Alerts can be ingested from many cloud platform vendors, and also from on-premise resources. Third, Chronicle SIEM. Chronicle SIEM is a part of the bigger Chronicle Security Operations. Chronicle SIEM collects security data and helps you identify the highest priority threats. While security tools, —including Google Cloud tools— are essential to any successful security operation, incident response is still a process that’s initiated by security professionals. When starting an incident response process, it's important to first capture the event or alert. This requires you to think about the information, its impact, where it came from, and how it affects normal operations. You must document and investigate events early, even if you're not sure if they're actionable. This will help you communicate clearly with your team and start an incident response process if needed. This video covered events and alerts, their place in incident response, and how security professionals assess and document findings. To be a thoughtful, action-oriented professional, you need to understand the tools and the information they provide, and how to interpret events and alerts. And by considering each alert’s origin, purpose, and impact, you’ll have the information you need to decide what actions to take.

- [YouTube: Security orchestration with playbooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgVq0aXk9JA)

Addressing security incidents can be complex and challenging in cloud environments. In addition, attacks can happen quickly, while incident investigation takes time. This is where security orchestration, automation, response platforms, and playbooks can help. Let's dive into these concepts. For example, say you’re working with a group of expert musicians, and you want to create a beautiful symphony. You need to coordinate the musicians playing each instrument to ensure everyone is playing in harmony. Security orchestration is similar, because your security team members are like musicians. And instead of creating a symphony, you’re managing an incident response. Orchestration helps you to streamline incident response efforts by coordinating specialized security tools, tasks, and processes. This coordination helps you save time, improve efficiency, and reduce the chances of human error. To help you with orchestration, you can use Chronicle SOAR, or SOAR for short. Chronicle SOAR is Google Cloud’s security orchestration, automation, and response platform. Similar to other SOAR platforms, Chronicle SOAR is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events. To harness the power of these tools, SOAR platforms work with a playbook, which is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Think of playbooks like a musical score that everyone follows to play in harmony. In incident response, playbooks provide predefined procedures that guide security teams through investigating and resolving incidents. Playbooks have defined triggers which cause security teams to take specific actions and make decisions. This enables fast incident response, helping free up time for security teams. So, why should you use playbooks as a security professional? Playbooks have several benefits. They help you automate repetitive tasks to save time and improve efficiency, and ensure consistency by requiring that teams consistently take all necessary steps. Playbooks also help to improve collaboration between security teams. They provide a common framework for communication and action. Playbooks also help security teams reduce risk by automating tasks prone to human error. Finally, playbooks improve compliance by ensuring that security teams follow all necessary procedures. Even better, you can build playbooks into your SOAR tool. In Chronicle SOAR, playbooks can be created, customized, and deployed to automate incident response workflows. Implementing a playbook helps security professionals effectively manage incidents. Chronicle playbooks begin with a trigger. The trigger is what initializes the playbook. It can be based on an alert from a security solution, like an endpoint detection and response platform. Then, there's the action. The action conducts an operation. For example, for a phishing incident, you might want to define an action like blocking the suspicious IP address that sent the phishing email. Lastly, there's the flow. The flow determines the progress of the playbook. It defines decision making substeps in the form of conditional statements. For example, imagine your organization receives an alert about a possible phishing email. You can use a playbook in Chronicle SOAR that automates each manual step involved in the incident response process of a phishing alert. This response process includes identifying and blocking malicious IP addresses, alerting the affected users, and resetting compromised passwords. Instead of having to toggle between different security platforms to perform an action, you simply let the playbook do its work. Here is an example of a phishing playbook in Chronicle's playbook designer. It's a simple flowchart with steps. Each step defines the triggers, actions, and the flow of the playbook. All these components work together to integrate and orchestrate tools used by security operations teams. Platforms like Chronicle SOAR and their playbooks can help you automate and coordinate systems during an incident response process, improving efficiency, aligning goals, and reducing the likelihood of human error. Keep in mind that SOAR playbooks for incident response are not 100% automated. Security analysts still need to customize and monitor playbooks to ensure they follow the correct process and that they’re effective in incident response. In addition, security analysts may need to take manual actions that are not automated, such as investigating alerts or communicating with stakeholders. When making a SOAR playbook, keep in mind a few best practices. First, make a plan. Prioritize tasks and processes in playbooks that are prone to human error, take a long time to accomplish, and have a high impact. Second, build with strategy. Make sure playbooks follow processes that align with your organization’s goals and industry best practices. And third, iterate. Learn from past incidents, and continuously refine and adapt playbooks to ensure they stay effective. As a security analyst, you can use automation and playbooks to simplify tasks and improve workflows to help you and your team. Platforms like Chronicle SOAR are a big help in incident response, so consider SOAR when you need to improve response efficiency and avoid errors.

My name is Fatima, and I'm a tech lead manager on Google's detection and response team. My role at Google requires me to stay up to date with the cybersecurity threat landscape and make decisions about what we need to build so we're in a good position to detect any cyber attacks against Google or Alphabet. It took me a while actually to get to cybersecurity and to understand that was the place I wanted to go. When I was in high school, I got the opportunity to work in a law firm, really making copies. Like, my job was, I was called a copy kid because I was a kid who made copies, and at one point I just started working with their IT systems and just trying to fix things here and there when things would break. We would have people who would lose important work documents or really cherished family photos. So I was exposed to that part of cybersecurity, the very human part, right, that it's not just a nuisance that somebody experiences on their computer, but it can really affect them in a different way. At that point in my life, I decided that cybersecurity was something that I wanted to pursue professionally. I wanted to fight the bad guys on the internet. Cybersecurity is like a performance. It's something that you prepare for for a long time, and then one day, it's time to put on the show. You have to be ready. You have to be ready to perform, and you have to be ready to perform at your best. For somebody who's just starting a career in cybersecurity, I would say learn how to code. Coding is extremely important, and learn the basics. Learn about networks. Learn about operating systems. Learn about web vulnerabilities. So learn all the fundamentals really well, and then after that, decide really what you want to focus on. What I've learned in my career is that nobody has a magic recipe for success. Everybody's just trying their best, and they're trying to figure it out in the moment. You might think that this other person just knows better and they have some magical skill that makes them more fit to do this type of work. I'm going to tell you that doesn't exist. The only thing that exists is really hard work and learning and developing your skill sets, and eventually you get better, and you kind of move on to that next phase of your career or your life. But there isn't, nobody has that kind of magical recipe and knows all the answers. Everybody's really just trying their best.

How do you ensure that business operations continue to run when disaster happens? In this video, we’ll explore a critical skill for any cloud security professional: executing a recovery plan. We’ll also provide you with practical examples, so you know what to expect when a plan is implemented. Let's get started. A recovery plan is like a roadmap. It’s a detailed guide that steers you on the path to restore operations in case of a disaster. This roadmap isn't just about returning to where you were before the disaster. It's about leveraging the experience to learn, grow, and improve. A recovery plan isn't a static document. Instead, it evolves over time as you learn from past incidents and adapt to new threats. As a security professional, you'll contribute to this growth and help your organization become more resilient with each challenge. As a security professional, you’ll likely be involved in recovery efforts. But it won’t just be you. Every person in an organization plays a role in the recovery process. Responsibilities during the execution of a recovery plan include assessing the situation, supporting the decision-making processes, communicating with stakeholders, and running specific recovery procedures. Now, let's apply these concepts to some scenarios. Imagine ransomware gains access to your network. Operations come to a standstill and critical data is lost. This is a difficult situation, but with a well-executed recovery plan, you and your team have options on how to respond. The recovery plan becomes your roadmap. It guides you to quarantine parts of the system that have been infected, eliminate the ransomware, restore the data from backups, get the system back online, and prevent significant downtime while resolving the issue that allowed it to happen. And remember, the recovery process isn’t over when the system is back up. You need to learn from what happened. Take the opportunity to analyze what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how you can prevent it in the future. In the event of an active cyberattack, the recovery plan can be your defense playbook. The recovery plan —serving as a playbook— can help you isolate affected systems, remove the threat, and then restore the systems to their previous state. In this video, we explored the crucial role of recovery plans and their impact on systems, teams, and organizations. Every plan —when put into action— is a chance to respond to an incident, learn from what happened, and help prevent a disaster.

Not everything goes according to plan. But that’s okay. With each challenge, there are opportunities to learn and improve. In this video, we’ll discuss a critical area that affects all of us working in Google Cloud environments: the recovery process. To keep systems running smoothly, you need to be prepared for the unexpected. Whether it's a cyber attack, natural disaster, or internal error, you’ll need to be able to recover quickly and efficiently. How well security operations teams can recover from a security incident can mean the difference between a minor inconvenience and a major catastrophe. So, how do you restore systems to their normal operations? If you need to get your systems back up and running on Google Cloud, there are a range of helpful tools available. With services like Google Cloud Backup and Google Cloud Disaster Recovery, you can quickly restore your data and applications. Plus, Google Cloud Storage and Persistent Disk keep your data safe and secure, so you won't have to worry about losing any of your data. After restoring your system, it's important to ensure that all components are functioning properly. Platforms like the Google Cloud Operations suite can help. The suite allows you to keep track of system performance, set up alerts, and prevent future issues. It's an excellent tool for maintaining your system's functionality and for confirming functionality after restoring your system. As a security professional, knowing how to manage recovery effectively in Google Cloud will help you in your professional development. As you develop skills in disaster recovery, you can help build trust with your team and the broader organization by ensuring business continuity in the face of disruption. Business continuity, or BC, is an organization’s ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing a risk disaster recovery plan. When you support business continuity in the context of cloud security, keep in mind that the cloud environment is dynamic and continuously evolving. So over time, you’ll find new tools and services to help enhance your recovery processes. Your knowledge of the latest tools, and desire to continuously learn, is a big advantage in the recovery process for your organization. So stay curious. As a cloud security professional, you need to understand the importance of the recovery process, the tools you can use, and how to best support your organization when restoring systems. Yet, in the fast-paced world of cloud operations, your duties may extend beyond just restoring services. You also need to guarantee data integrity, preserve users' trust, and face any obstacles with confidence. By consistently exploring, learning, and retaining knowledge, you can become more valuable in this ever-changing field. And your company and coworkers will certainly appreciate your contributions.

Knowing how to respond to a crisis is a valuable skill in cloud security. In this video, we’ll explore an area that is critically important for any cloud-based operation: business continuity and disaster recovery, or BCDR tools. Let's get started. So, what's BCDR all about? Simply put, business continuity and disaster recovery are like a safety net. They’re critical in security operations because they ensure that when disaster strikes, business operations are active, and data remains safe and accessible. There's a variety of BCDR tools available to Security Operations teams, each with its unique purpose. These tools can range from BCDR plan builders, and backup and restore utilities to sophisticated software that handles data center failovers. And all these BCDR tools all share a common goal: to protect your business from the negative effects of a disaster. These tools can also help you make and execute a plan to restore your systems and get data back online. They ensure you can continue normal operations and continue serving your users without any interruption. So, no matter the size or scope of the problem, there’s a BCDR tool available to help. Now, let's explore BCDR in Google Cloud. Google Cloud offers BCDR tools designed specifically for its cloud environment to assist with regular backup and recovery operations. As a security professional, Google Cloud BCDR tools help with key aspects of business continuity and disaster recovery. For example, you can test and establish backup and recovery processes, test data management, and verify a documented backup plan. Here’s an example. Imagine your team can’t mitigate a ransomware attack in time. Multiple systems are affected, so you need to utilize backup and disaster recovery tools to restore normal operations. Before you begin the process of restoring the affected systems, you need to prioritize the restoration of critical business systems. First, you isolate the affected system —like a server or virtual machine— and terminate the ransomware task. Then, you restore the system to the most recent recovery point from the last unaffected backup. By using cloud-based BCDR tools, your security operations team can be confident that completely different infrastructure is in use, rather than a compromised network. Once the new system is running, the security team connects the recovered system to the network, so that end users can return to work, and operations can continue. So remember, these BCDR tools are not just pieces of software, they're what you can use to ensure your business continues to run smoothly and efficiently during disaster recovery.

Hello and welcome to the next step in your cloud security journey. In this video, we’ll explore the critical world of business continuity and disaster recovery, or BCDR for short, within Google Cloud. BCDR ensures your operations continue despite unexpected disasters or threats. Google Cloud provides lots of tools that integrate seamlessly with BCDR planning and execution, making protecting your organization's data easier. That way, you can keep your services running after a disaster. Let's examine a BCDR tool in Google Cloud. Google Cloud Backup and DR is a backup and disaster recovery solution that enables organizations to quickly recover data, so that they can continue running critical business operations. To get started with Google Cloud Backup and DR, you'll need to first create a backup plan. You can use the backup plan to define the parameters of your backup. For example, how often to back up your data, how long to retain the backups, and where and how to replicate the backups. Once you've created your backup plan, you can restore your data whenever you need to with just a couple of clicks. For example, if your organization is targeted by ransomware, employees might not be able to access files encrypted by the ransomware. Business operations will be negatively affected, and employees won’t be able to do work until they can access the data. After the security team successfully contains the ransomware, you use the backup plan to quickly find and deploy a backup that has not been infected with ransomware. This allows you to quickly recover your data and get operations back to normal. We've reviewed backup plans, but what about disaster recovery plans? Let's examine what you should consider when creating a Disaster Recovery Plan, or DRP, within Google Cloud. For example, it’s important to consider how backups will be set up through replication, what your measures of success during a recovery are, and what happens if there's a failover. You’ll also need to test the plan and have maintenance strategies. And lastly, you should consider the cost implications of a disaster. This includes the cost of downtime if your organization is unable to operate and the cost of restoring data. Let’s discuss these considerations in more detail. First is replication, or the process of continuously creating copies of data to multiple locations to support availability. Replication is vital to any disaster recovery plan because it helps ensure that data can be quickly restored. While working in the cloud, it’s important to consider replication options that utilize storage in different regions of the world. For example, OnVault can be used to safely store backup data from virtual machines. Another option is StreamSnap, which is used for data mirroring. Data mirroring creates exact copies of data in remote locations. This provides opportunities for replication across multiple regions to improve data availability during a disaster. Now that you’ve learned how data is backed up, let’s discuss measures of success. These include how often data backups happen, and how quickly you’ll need to get business operations back to normal when carrying out a disaster recovery plan. In a disaster recovery plan, you need to decide how much data can be lost, and how long systems can be down. Both are critical measurements of success for a disaster recovery plan. Google Cloud's compute, storage, networking, and software services can support your team in making these objectives possible. Next, let's examine failover, which helps protect systems from failure. For failover scenarios, deploying Compute Engine and managed instance groups can provide automatic failover in the event of an instance or zone failure. For example, imagine your organization uses Google Cloud to run a critical application on Compute Engine. The application is deployed in a single zone. Keep in mind that a failure in one zone affects all of the resources in that zone. So if the organization wants to improve the critical application's availability, they need to add failover. The organization can achieve improved application availability by creating a managed instance group with two instances located in different zones. The application can then be configured to run on both instances. If one instance fails, the other instance will continue to run the application. As always, testing your disaster recovery plan is crucial. In the previous example, the organization can also set up regular disaster recovery testing to verify if the failover works as intended. As a security professional, you can test your plan periodically and conduct tests to simulate a computer instance failure. If the testing fails, you are alerted and can investigate and address the issue. Conducting regular disaster recovery testing will ensure your plan is effective and can help you identify improvement areas. Finally, here’s a pro tip. Maintaining your disaster recovery plan is key. Your company’s cloud presence will change over time, and your disaster plan needs to change accordingly. Your plan needs regular maintenance to stay current. Now that you know more about setting up and maintaining a backup and disaster recovery plan in the cloud, you’re well prepared to help your organization navigate security disasters with confidence.

In this video, we’ll explore one of the most critical aspects of a security professional’s role: disaster recovery. Recovery is more than just a backup plan. It works alongside prevention efforts. But when prevention doesn't work and disaster occurs, a speedy and efficient recovery is essential to keep business operations running smoothly. Recovery is a team effort. All members of a security team must know how they contribute to recovery processes. They also must maintain awareness of business continuity standards and timelines. Business continuity ensures that your company’s operations are uninterrupted at all times. And when a disaster strikes, recovery is a corrective measure that can get your company back on track. There are several recovery options to use in the event of a disaster. But the recovery option you choose will depend on the type of security disaster you encounter. To help you make the right call, let’s review the different types of recovery options. Backup restoration is a common practice and recovery option security professionals use to recreate a system from its most recent stable backup. Another recovery option is redundancy, which is the practice of having multiple copies of data in different locations to avoid a single point of failure. Copying data across multiple zones has a lot of benefits. It improves the availability of cloud resources and prevents potential disruptions in the event of a failure or disaster. For example, if system A fails, a redundancy mechanism can automatically start, allowing system A-1 to take over to minimize downtime and maintain availability. Cloud providers like Google Cloud provide backup and restore recovery options and replication for databases, giving security professionals a quick way to recover lost data. To support backup and restore efforts, cloud providers offer failover and redundancy services. These services manage heavy traffic loads using load balancers. Load balancers improve the performance of services or applications by distributing network traffic across resources. In the context of recovery, if a server fails or suddenly becomes unavailable, load balancers identify this change in server performance. Then, load balancers work to provide availability by evenly distributing traffic across the other servers. Another recovery option is warm standby. With this strategy, a duplicate system is always running in the cloud, but on a much smaller scale. The duplication is fully configured and operational, so in case of a disaster, security professionals can scale up this system to run quickly. Now that you’re familiar with a few recovery options, let’s discuss how security professionals use these recovery options on the job. Disaster recovery strategies are included in a disaster recovery plan, or DRP for short. A DRP is like a to-do list that includes the details you need when a security disaster occurs. A DRP also includes measures of success. The success of a recovery effort is not only when a business returns to normal operations, but how quickly the recovery happens and what data is lost when the system is down. These measures of success are known as recovery point objectives, or RPOs, and recovery time objectives, or RTOs. A recovery point objective, RPO, is the maximum acceptable length of time during which data might be lost from an application due to a major incident. A recovery point objective defines how much data you can afford to lose if a system goes down. As a security professional, an RPO informs how often you backup your systems and how you use redundancy. RPO also typically involves a data backup policy. For example, during the event of a failure, a financial organization like a bank needs a low RPO. In this context, a low RPO ensures that the bank can restore its data as close as possible to the point of failure. Not only does this minimize potential data loss, it provides the bank’s customers with access to their information. However, a small local bookstore that uses manual data entry might not need a low RPO, because losing a few hours of their data during a failure might not significantly affect their business operations. Recovery time objective, RTO, is the target time allowed for the recovery of a service in the event of a disaster. An organization’s RTO is how long they can afford to wait until data is restored from a backup, or how long a system can be down before it’s back up and running after a failure. For example, if an organization specifies their RTO as 1 to 2 business days, this means they can accept 1 to 2 business days of downtime in the event of a disaster. In this video, we explored recovery, and discussed how recovery strategies, like backups and redundancy, can be applied and measured using RPO and RTO. Keep in mind that when prevention isn't enough, recovery steps can help you get your organization up and running, even after a security disaster.

Organizations often create disaster preparedness plans. By planning in advance, organizations can better navigate challenges and unexpected events. Security professionals also plan for unexpected events. In this video, we’ll explore Disaster Recovery Planning, also known as DRP. When all else fails, a well-constructed DRP ensures that business operations can continue. It’s the survival kit that keeps an organization going during unexpected disruptions. Let’s unpack the kit, and explore each of the four key components of a Disaster Recovery Plan. The first component of a DRP is roles and responsibilities. Having an established list of roles and responsibilities ensures your team knows how to communicate and collaborate with other employees, vendors, and customers. The second component of a Disaster Recovery Plan is critical systems, applications, data, and resources. The DRP should include documentation of which systems, applications, data, and other resources are most critical for business continuity, and how to bring them back online when they’re down. The third DRP component is to make plans for testing and optimization. It’s important that your team continues to test and update its strategy to address ever-evolving threats and business needs. The fourth DRP component is a risk assessment. A risk assessment considers strategies for potential hazards and the necessary resources to resume business operations. The assessment should include clearly defined recovery point objectives and recovery time objectives. Remember, a recovery point objective, or RPO, is the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption occurs. For example, imagine you’re working on a crucial project that depends on a constant stream of live data. Suddenly, without warning, your system crashes. The clock is ticking, and each passing second means more data is lost. How much data can be lost before it starts to impact the company? Thirty seconds worth of data, thirty minutes, or 3 hours? These are the questions RPOs are meant to answer. A recovery time objective, or RTO, is the maximum acceptable amount of time allowed for the recovery of a service in the event of a disaster. When setting an RTO, security professionals need to know the maximum amount of time a system can be offline. To figure out the answer, they’ll ask questions like, How long can business operations dependent on a specific system be down? And how quickly does the system need to be operational before the impact becomes severe? For example, imagine you work for a global financial technology company that provides financial services through a cloud-based app. Their services are accessible to millions of customers around the world at any time of day. One day, the company is targeted for a distributed denial of service attack. The attack overwhelms the company’s servers and systems, causing the app to go offline. The outage causes severe service disruptions, impacting customers all over the world in an instant. Unfortunately, your team’s efforts to mitigate and resolve the attack are not successful. Your defenses are overwhelmed, the system stays down, and the app remains unreachable. Your last line of defense is the disaster recovery plan. So the team activates the cloud-hosted DRP, which outlines the steps the team needs to follow to recover critical cloud resources. Your team’s designated personnel, including security engineers and stakeholders, access the DRP. Now, everyone on the team knows their roles and responsibilities, and collaborates effectively to get servers and systems back online. By leveraging the scalability and distribution of the cloud, your team is able to redirect and recreate network traffic, computing, and data from failovers and backups. All of the redirection and restoration efforts are then guided by predefined RTOs and RPOs, ensuring that downtime and data loss are within acceptable limits. Critical systems then come back online, and the bank’s customers are able to access the app once again. As you might imagine, this recovery process is not an every day action. It’s the safety net when everything else fails. Now that you’ve explored the components of a Disaster Recovery Plan and worked through a security scenario, you understand the process to support recovery when the unexpected happens.

Ready to learn more about a vital part of cloud security? In this video, we'll discuss the differences between business continuity and disaster recovery, also known as BCDR. We'll also discuss how to build BCDR plans and examine how they’re used in Google Cloud. Business continuity, or BC, is an organization’s ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing a risk disaster recovery plan. Disaster recovery, or DR, is a strategic and systematic approach to recovering essential infrastructure and systems when a disaster happens. Business continuity and disaster recovery work towards the same goal: ensuring your organization is impacted as little as possible during a disaster or event. Security professionals often refer to these two concepts together as BCDR. Let’s explore disaster recovery and business continuity plans in more detail. When building either of these plans, there are three considerations to keep in mind. First, both plans start with a risk assessment. A risk assessment helps you and your team identify threats, and evaluate their impact. This can also help you thoroughly document and set up a priority list. Next, a business impact analysis is necessary for you and your team to identify which critical operations need to be prioritized when a disaster happens. And finally, organizations use strategic planning to outline various disaster scenarios so they can focus their efforts on minimizing disruption, recovering lost information, and restoring regular business operations as soon as possible. All three of these considerations are necessary for teams to create business continuity and disaster recovery plans that help ensure successful outcomes. Both plans consider what systems need to be prioritized and how to address prioritized systems during a disaster. But each plan considers these factors differently. Every organization is unique, so each organization’s goals and plans for disaster recovery and business continuity must be tailored to their needs. Let's explore some of the tools and features in Google Cloud that a security team can use to implement both BC and DR plans. An important part of Google Cloud’s BC and DR strategy is using the BCDR recovery tool. This tool is a powerful asset that provides additional assurance that your systems can get back up and running quickly after a disaster. Also, Google Cloud’s automation features allow for automatic backups and failover systems. This key feature ensures that your data remains intact and your operations continue functioning, even when disaster strikes. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are important for any security team, and they should be tested continuously. Now that you know more about BC and DR plans, you can build effective plans to manage disasters and support your organization.

As a security professional responsible for disaster recovery, it’s important to consider who is impacted by a situation as you respond to it. In this video, you’ll learn about the important role stakeholders play in disaster recovery planning. Because they’re usually the decision makers, stakeholders should be prepared to participate when security disasters happen. There are three main groups of stakeholders that work in and around a disaster recovery plan. The first group includes executive stakeholders. These stakeholders are the decision makers. They establish the budget and outline the strategic course of action for recovery. A Chief Information Officer, or CIO, is an executive stakeholder. The CIO is responsible for setting the stage for the recovery process. They consider business requirements and technological capabilities, so they’re ultimately accountable for a successful recovery. Next are operational stakeholders. Operational stakeholders work with executive stakeholders to ensure that recovery plans meet the organization's requirements. They’re also responsible for implementing the plans. For example, managers of a Security Operations Team are operational stakeholders. Managers implement the CIO's plan. Finally, technical stakeholders form the first line of defense in the event of a disaster. They work with operational stakeholders to make sure their organization's systems are safe, and can get back up and running. During a disaster, technical stakeholders are responsible for the initial fallout. They document and mitigate risks and address any issues that arise. They also coordinate responses, implement emergency procedures, and help in the recovery process to restore operations with minimal downtime. They may have different roles, but these stakeholders don't work alone. Instead, they work together and communicate effectively to help an organization fully recover. Effective and timely communication keeps information moving so that everyone understands their responsibilities and can perform their duties when the time comes. What happens when existing communication channels become compromised or unavailable? It's important for teams to consider the possibility of limited communication and implement solutions in advance. This is where out of band communications come into play. Out of band communications are alternative methods of communicating that can be used when normal channels become compromised or unavailable. These methods are especially important to ensure stakeholders and team members can communicate during an event or disaster. In large organizations, it's common for teams to perform disaster recovery processes in isolation from other teams. Disasters can have wide-ranging impacts on an organization, so members from different departments, like legal or compliance, need to be aware of disaster recovery efforts. So, it's important to maintain communications across teams during disaster recovery to keep everyone up to date. While stakeholders have different roles, there are a few key things they should all be able to do during a disaster. First, stakeholders need to understand their role and what responsibility they have in their organization. Next, they should be able to implement clear and timely communication. And finally, stakeholders should value their role and the contributions they make during recovery, because they’re an essential piece of the recovery effort. A successful disaster recovery plan depends on the coordination and communication of its dedicated stakeholders. The people who come together in a collaborative effort to recover from a disaster need to communicate effectively, share an understanding of recovery efforts, and acknowledge each stakeholder's role in the process.

Nice work on completing another section. You’ve learned a lot. Let's take a moment to quickly revisit what you've learned. First, you learned about the critical aspects of recovery. Then, you learned about business continuity and disaster recovery including tools and best practices. You learned about key recovery metrics that organizations consider when recovering information, like determining how long systems can remain down and how much data can be lost during a disaster. Finally, you learned all about responsibilities and stakeholders involved in recovery efforts and the relationship between business continuity and disaster recovery. Business continuity and disaster recovery is a critical part of an organization's security posture and response efforts. As a cloud security professional, you'll utilize BCDR tools to efficiently respond to security incidents and maintain operations.

Hi, I am Patrick. Hi, I am Pedro. It's time for another chance to join an interview that's in progress. In this interview, topics will cover cloud cybersecurity questions related to detecting, responding, and recovering from attacks. We hope this will help you prepare for your next interview. Hey, Pedro, what interests you in a career in cloud cybersecurity, and what are you looking for in a new role? Well, my background is in computer science, and I'm really interested in dealing with problems that have to do with scale. And all cloud does is centralize your infrastructure for your customer, for your project in one place. And that lets you focus on problems that are actually interesting instead of physical, for instance, like where is the data? Who's protecting the data center? And what I want out of a career in cloud cybersecurity is to grow. I wanna learn, I wanna find new problems and solve interesting challenges. Tell me about a time you faced a challenge and how you responded. When I started in sophomore year and I asked my professor whether or not I wanted to do research, he asked me, "Do you even know what that entails?" And I said, "Absolutely not." And he was like, "Well, pick a topic. Go figure out what a problem is that you think you can solve and would be interesting and go solve it." It turns out that solving that is way more involved than you think, and it involves having and developing a variety of skills that you might never even have thought were relevant. How long did it take you to find the topic? About six months. We were dealing with IoT devices and cryptography, and I was trying to find some way of mixing those together. And we ended up measuring basically the performance efficiency of a YES on hardware in IoT. And just digging into that whole space, I realized that my interests lie in performance efficiency and cryptography, and those kind of mix the two together. Pedro, can you gimme an example of an incident that a cloud-based organization might have on their infrastructure? How could a cloud cybersecurity analyst detect such an incident? So in the case of Log4j, there's a few ways that you might go about it. Number one, you might go for what's called static analysis. You might use Google Cloud's managed infrastructure to determine which packages are running the vulnerable versions of Log4j. Another way is you might look for indicators of compromise, IOCs, in the logs themselves, and you might use something like Google Logging and the Chronicle SIEM to go and identify the places where the vulnerability was carried out successfully. And finally, you probably wanna spin up a generic incident response team that handles any edge cases that you haven't thought of in advance because the chaos always happens. So from the Log4j example that you gave, what is a positive takeaway that you got from, you know, detecting such an incident? One thing the world learned about as a result of the Log4j thing is to be scared of strings. I think the entire world is much more familiar with the concepts of string interpolation and the implications that that might have. And as a result, it brings kind of these high like complexity, hard computer science topics like what is string interpolation and it makes you realize, maybe I should learn about that. Let's suppose you're gonna use cloud data security controls to detect data disk storage related incidents. What are some examples of tools they would use and what do they detect? So the very first thing I would do for my own managed infrastructure on cloud is look at the severity of the data. Are we talking PII, private information, or are we talking machine to machine transactions? And for this, I would rely heavily on cloud logging. I need to know exactly what information was being stored and who accessed it and at what time, and start correlating some of the activity around the access of the data to see exactly what happened. Okay. So let's say you start doing that and you start seeing some of the logs and such, but you're not really sure what's going on. What would you do if you had concerns about the people that access the logs? Like who accessed the logs and why did they access it? Yeah, no, this is a big problem and it's actually solved at least in part by cloud, but this concept called audit logging. So you might have process logging that tells you what's happening on a system, which port is talking to which port, that kind of thing. But access logging is more like who touched the data with what justification, was that a valid access? Did someone else authenticate them on their behalf saying that they could perform such an action? And so we definitely, in addition to the analysis around what happened for the incident, would want to go and look at any data accesses both during the incident and afterwards. Right? We have to make sure that our responders are also following the rules. So imagine the scenario where you're responsible for writing an incident report. What are some critical pieces of information that must be included in the report? The report is super important and it's very multifaceted too. So there's a part about the incident itself, right? How severe was it? What were the effect that assets? What are the indicators of compromise? And ideally you share those out broadly and contribute back to the community. So there's that kind of the incident itself and the outcomes and the learnings. But then there's also the organizational side, right? Where did we succeed? What were some misses? What are some opportunities for improvement? And it's always really important to include those two sections because you have to focus in on the fact that you are doing a good job and you are improving on catching these incidents. Pedro, thank you. That's the end of the interview and now it's your turn to ask me any questions you might have. From your perspective, what keeps you up at night about information security? The one that I feel like I'm thinking about a lot that I don't hear very often is that the ever increasing layers of abstraction that we put onto all of the world's infrastructure have made it impossible for a person to actually reason about the risks of that infrastructure. And therefore it's really hard to secure it or solve it. Yeah. And that problem is not gonna get easier to solve over time, especially as the cloud infrastructure scales. Thanks for watching. In this scenario, Pedro demonstrated how to end responses with positive takeaways when answering questions. During an interview, you can demonstrate your ability to learn from your experiences and recover from difficult situations by sharing positive takeaways when relevant.

You made it to the end of this course. Congratulations. You did it. Personally, I love working in cybersecurity because it's ever-evolving, challenging, yet so fun and rewarding. You get to help make the digital landscape from everyday systems to emerging technologies a safer place for everyone. You're well on your way to helping protect people and assets in the cloud. We've covered quite a bit. Let’s take a moment to review what you’ve learned. First, we began with the foundations of incident detection. You learned about the role of security operations in detecting and mitigating threats. You explored the phases involved in incident management. And you considered the fundamentals of logging and the importance of monitoring and detection tools in providing alerts and notifications. Then, we focused on applied detection, where you learned about how cloud tools and techniques are used to identify threats. You learned about the anatomy of an attack using Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® and the importance of managing false positive alerts. You also explored cloud monitoring tools, indicators of compromise, and proactive detection through threat hunting. Next, you learned all about the various processes involved in incident response, such as the importance of evidence preservation, effective documentation, and optimizing response through automation. Finally, we ended with incident recovery, where you learned about how security teams recover from a security incident using business continuity and disaster recovery planning. You learned a lot about incident response in the cloud. Great job. As a cloud security analyst, you'll find yourself dealing with challenges related to incidents. You’ll use what you’ve learned in this course to better manage the incidents you encounter. Coming up, you'll apply all that you've learned in the final course with the capstone project. Good luck.
