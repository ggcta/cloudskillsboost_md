person: Hello, and welcome. In this course, you'll be introduced to some of the more advanced features found in Google Sheets. We do recommend that you complete the Google Sheets basic training before taking this course. Google Sheets is Google's cloud-based spreadsheet software, included with Google workspace. With Google Sheets, you can create and edit spreadsheets directly in your web browser. No special software is required. Multiple people can work simultaneously, you can see people's changes as they make them, and every change is saved automatically. During this course, through a series of lectures, demonstrations, and hands on activities, you will become even more comfortable using Google Sheets. We encourage you to stay signed in to Google workspaces throughout the course, not just for the activities. Pause the video, lecture, or demonstration at any time, and explore and practice for yourself to ensure that you understand the topic being discussed. This course follows our fictional customer, On the Rise, as they embark on their Google workspace journey. At the end of the course, you will use Google Sheets to solve a particular business challenge being faced by On the Rise. So let's take a look at the scenario we'll be using as you learn more about Google Sheets. On the Rise bakeries has recently started to use Google Sheets to compile and analyze their hiring data. Partner owner, Thomas Omar, has been so pleased with the increased visibility into the data, that he has asked the leadership team to use the same approach with the sales data. Thomas notes that he would like to have a visual representation of recent On the Rise sales, so he can easily see what is happening at a glance. He mentions a few new locations in Asia Pacific, which are of particular interest to him. He'd like to see how these stores are performing. The leadership team asks for your help. They would like you to create a Google Form so that the Asia Pacific stores can easily and securely share their sales data. The leadership team also asks for your help converting the data into two visual graphics, so that they can determine which stores might need some help. By using Google Forms and Google Sheets, the leadership team hope to gain clarity so they can respond in a positive way and help the new stores grow. Ready to get started? Let's begin.

person: Let's start by going over the agenda for the course. Module one begins with a look at advanced formatting with Google Sheets. You'll learn how to apply and customize themes in Google Sheets and explore conditional formatting options. In module two, you will learn about some of Google Sheets' advanced formulas and functions. We will look at creating formulas, using functions, and referencing and validating data. Spreadsheets can hold millions of numbers, formulas, and text. Making sense of all that data can be difficult without a summary or visualization. In module three, we will explore the data visualization options in Google Sheets, such as charts and pivot tables. We'll also look at ways to automate repetitive tasks using macros. Module four introduces Google Forms. Google Forms are online surveys used to collect data and provide the opportunity for quick data analysis. In this module, we're going to examine how forms and sheets work together by connecting collected form data to a spreadsheet or by creating a form from an existing spreadsheet. And at the end of the course, you will use Google Sheets to help Thomas Omar from On the Rise solve his forecasting challenge.

## Advanced formatting in a Google Sheet

There are many advanced formatting options that help you customize your Google Sheets and leverage your data. In this module, we are going to talk about applying themes and conditional formatting options.

### Video - [Advanced formatting in a Google Sheet](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529040)

person: Welcome to Module One, advanced formatting in a Google Sheet. There are many advanced formatting options that help you customize your Google Sheets and leverage your data. In this module, we're going to talk about applying themes and conditional formatting options. Google Sheets has themes that can be applied to change the format of an entire spreadsheet. To view the themes, open the Format menu and click Theme. The themes panel will open on the right side of the sheet. Click the theme to apply to the spreadsheet. Themes can also be customized. Choose a theme and then click the Customize button to view and change its font, text color, chart background color, accent colors, and hyperlink color. Changes to themes are specific to the spreadsheet where they are modified. You may consider creating a sheets template to be able to reuse your chosen formatting in a new spreadsheet. Individual cells can still be formatted after the theme has been applied. Conditional formatting is a Google Sheets feature that automatically applies cell formatting if the contents of a cell meets predefined criteria, known as format rules. Conditional formatting is advantageous, as the formatting is applied automatically and in real time. So as data is entered into a sheet, the formatting will instantly highlight important information, such as the results of data entry or calculations. This is true even in large datasets. Conditional formatting can also be used to ensure errors are minimized. For example, duplicate or inaccurate data could be highlighted for quick correction or removal. Let's take a closer look at conditional formatting now.

### Video - [Conditional formatting](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529041)

- [YouTube: Conditional formatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nGD0gsdH-Y)

person: To apply conditional formatting to data, open the Format menu and click Conditional Formatting. The conditional format rules panel will appear on the right side of the Sheet. Choose between a single color or color skill style. Choose the range of cells to apply the formatting to by entering the beginning cell address and end cell address. Or click the Select Data Range to click and drag to select the cells to format. In this case, let's make all the cells that fall under 200,000 red. Create a rule or rules by selecting an option from the Format Cells If... Then choose the text format to apply. Click Default to select from the six preconfigured styles, or create a custom style with bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, text color, and cell background color. Click Done to apply the conditional formatting, or click Plus Add Another Rule to add another condition. Rules are applied in order and a range in each cell within it once formatted by a rule will not be changed by subsequent rules. When creating a color scale rule, choose a cell range. Click Default to choose a color scale or create a custom color scale. Choose a minimum value and a maximum value for the scale. A midpoint can also be specified. Click Done to apply the formatting or add another rule to layer more conditions on the data.

## Advanced formulas and functions

Formulas and functions allow you to make quick calculations and better use your data. Google Sheets supports many of the formulas found in other spreadsheet applications. In this module, we are going to look at creating a formula, using functions, and referencing and validating data. We will also discuss how using named ranges can assist you when working with data sets.

### Video - [Advanced formulas and functions](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529045)

person: Welcome to Module Two, Advanced Formulas and Functions. Formulas and functions allow you to make quick calculations and better use your data. Google Sheets supports many of the formulas found in other spreadsheet applications. In this module, we're going to look at creating a formula, using functions, and referencing and validating data. We will also see how using named ranges can assist you when working with data sets. You can perform many different types of calculations by using functions to create formulas in Google Sheets. There are hundreds of functions in Sheets that can be used to create formulas to execute all sorts of calculations and manipulation of data. To see an up-to-date list of the supported functions, select the function list option from the Google Sheets Help menu. In the Sheets basics course, we covered cell addresses. Google Sheets uses the A1 notation for addresses, which is the column letter followed by the row number. A cell in column E row 56 has an address of E56. When referencing the cell in a formula, the address E56 will return the contents of the cell. There are two different types of cell references when copying the contents of a cell or including it in a formula. Relative references change when a formula is copied from one cell to another in the spreadsheet. An absolute reference will remain the same when they are copied. The default behavior in Google Sheets is to use relative referencing for formulas. For example, if a formula in cell A3 is =A1+B1, copying it to cell B3 will automatically update the formula to =B1+C1, relative to its current location. Absolute references, on the other hand, do not change when copied to a new cell. The references in the formula will remain constant. When creating formulas, simply place a dollar symbol in front of the cell address to make an absolute reference to it. Google Sheets supports logical functions based on conditions. Using the function "IF", a formula can be created using "and" or "and not" to test the value in Excel and define a result that appears in a cell displaying that result. If formulas are made up of a logical expression, which is a condition that the function is checking in reference to a value or calculation, and a value to return if the expression is true or false. Let's look at an example to show you how this works.

### Video - [Using IF and IFS to analyze data](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529046)

- [YouTube: Using IF and IFS to analyze data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBlV7gy9kY)

Person: Imagine an on-the-rise regional sales manager wishes to quickly see which store is exceeding its sales goals and which is not by looking at the sales to date in a Google Sheet. The sales manager has a spreadsheet with several columns-- City, State/Province, Country, Region, Month, Product, Sales - Actual, Sales - Forecast, and Sales to date. The manager adds a tenth column, Goal Status, and creates a formula using the IF function to display when a store is exceeding their sales goal or when they have missed their sales goal for the first six months as shown in the Sales to date column, column I. Our first sales to date total is shown for Bogotá, Colombia, in cell I37. So let's add our formula to cell J37. The formula is written as: =IF(I37 >150000, "Exceeded Goal", "Missed Goal"). Let's break down the formula to get a better understanding of how it will work. After calling the IF function, the formula references cell I37, which contains the sales to date, year to date result for the first store. The regular expression is completed with ">150000" which tests the number in the cell against the goal sales dollars of $150,000. If you copy the formula down the J column, the results are displayed. If the number in the I column is true-- greater than 150,000-- the corresponding J cell reports "Exceeded Goal." If the number in the I column is false-- less than 150,000-- the corresponding J cell reports "Missed Goal." Are these results helpful? The sales to date calculation is only in some of the cells, not all of the cells. An empty cell is less than 150,000, so each empty cell has a "Missed Goal" report. How can we make this easier to read and more representative of what we are trying to learn about each store? Let's add another "Goal Status" column and use the IFS function to make the information more useful. We still want to know if a store has met or exceeded its sales target, so we will use the same approach. If the sales to date value is equal to or greater than $150,000, the store has exceeded its goal. If the sales to date value is less than $150,000, the store has missed its goal. But there is an additional factor we would like to consider: what happens if there is no information in the cell? You want the response to be a blank cell as well. Using the IFS function, you can consider all of these options. The IFS statement is written in this way: =IFS(I37 ="", "", I37 >=150000, "Exceeded Goal", I37<150000, "Missed Goal") Note that the formula considers the operations in order. Since an empty cell is less than $150,000, this operation should go first to ensure that when a cell is blank or empty, the formula will report a blank cell. When we copy the formula in column K, we can see there are now three options reported about how well the stores are doing related to their goals. This information will be more helpful to a sales manager who is quickly trying to determine if there needs to be any support given to a store because they have missed their sales goal.

- [YouTube: Data validation and named ranges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-tVS_a--U)

Person: When entering data into a Google Sheet manually-- especially if there are a lot of entries and collaborators adding data-- it's helpful to ensure that what is entered into a cell is valid in the context of the sheet. For example, On the Rise wants to enter puff pastry orders into a Google Sheet. A few of the columns for the orders are puff pastry type, and puff pastry size. For data entry into these columns, it would reduce errors to prevent anything being added That is not valid for the data type. With data validation, entries for puff pastry type can be limited to just the four types that the company has, along with the three available sizes in the size column. Any data that is not valid could be rejected with a help text that details the only values that can be entered. Or even more useful, the cells in each column could have a dropdown list with the appropriate values to select from when adding to the sheet. All of this is accomplished with data validation. To create data validation rules, open the data menu and click "Data validation." Or right-click a cell and click on "Data validation" in the menu. The data validation dialog will appear. Choose a cell range for your data validation rule to apply to. Add criteria, which is the data that will be accepted for the entry in the range. The criteria can be a list from a range, a list of items, number, text, date, checkbox, or a custom formula. Data will be validated upon entry, but to ensure there are no typos or incorrect values, check the "Show dropdown list in cell" box to speed up accurate entries. When invalid data is entered, choose to either show a warning or to reject the input. And a tooltip can be displayed when a person hovers their pointer over the cell with custom text if the box for "show validation help" is checked. Click "Save" to apply the validation. When you or a collaborator enter a value in the cell or cell range where the data validation rules are applied, they will be enforced by Google Sheets. When working with data sets in Google Sheets, it can improve accuracy and efficiency to name ranges of data in a sheet. Once a range is named, it can be referenced by that name in a formula. So instead of a formula for calculating sales results for the year being written as "=SUM(A3:D15, F3:F15)," it could be "=SUM(monthly results, rep totals)," which is more human-readable and easier to understand for collaborators also editing the sheet. To add a named range, open the data menu and click "Named ranges," or right-click on a cell or selected range and click "Define named range" from the menu. The named ranges panel will open on the right side of the sheet. Enter a name for your range. If necessary, click to enter the range address or select it in the sheet. Then click "Done." Now you can use a named range as a reference in formulas in the sheet.

## Analyze and report

Spreadsheets can hold millions of numbers, formulas, and text. Making sense of all of that data can be difficult without a summary or visualization, especially when presenting the data to colleagues, partners, prospects, or clients. In this module, we are going to explore the data visualization options in Google Sheets, such as charts and pivot tables. We will discuss how Google Workspace integration makes it easy to share your charts and tables in Google Docs and Google Slides. We also look at ways to automate repetitive tasks using macros.

person: Welcome to Module Three, Analyze and Report. Spreadsheets can hold millions of numbers, formulas, and text. Making sense of all that data can be difficult without a summary or visualization, especially when presenting the data to others. In this module, we are going to explore the data visualization options in Google Sheets, such as charts and pivot tables. We will discuss how Google workspace integration makes it easy to share your charts and tables in Google Docs and Google Slides. We'll also look at ways to automate repetitive tasks using macros. Google Sheets has a number of different charts and graphs that allow you to present and summarize data in a sheet. Each chart type represents a different way to display data, and can be customized with background colors, fonts, and more. Understanding the message you are trying to share will help you determine which of the various Google Sheets chart types best conveys your message. You can choose from line, column, bar, pie, histogram, scatter diagrams, and even maps. But sometimes, creating the chart you need from the spreadsheet you have may be a little difficult. Let's take a look at some of the common issues and how to solve them.

### Video - [Exploring charts](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529054)

- [YouTube: Exploring charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oRprhdVUQA)

person: To explore some of the problems you may encounter when trying to make a chart to analyze the data you've gathered, let's look at the spreadsheet from the basics course, "On the Rise monthly sales figures." Sometimes, there's too much information to show a chart with meaning. Be careful the data range you select. You may only want to select a smaller section of the information. Column A is the North American region; row one lists the quarters. While this information is helpful when looking at the data in the spreadsheet, it may not be helpful as you create the chart. You wouldn't want to select cells A1 through N10 to create a chart. Consider selecting only B2 through N10 to find information about the monthly sales for each region. To create a chart, select Insert from the toolbar, and select "Chart." In the Chart editor, select the Chart type "Line chart." For Data range, type in B2:N10. For X-axis, select "Region" if it's not already selected by default. Under Series, check "Switch rows/columns" and "Use column B as the header," so that the chart illustrates the sales by month for each region. Under Customize, click on the arrow at Chart & axis titles, and type in "Monthly Sales by Region" for the chart title. When you need to select information to show or not show in a chart, you can hide rows or columns. For example, if you only want to see information for North America, you can hide rows eight through ten, and all you'll see in the chart are now the monthly sales for North American regions. But there is something important to note. If you have sums at the end of each row or column and you hide some of the rows or columns, the sums calculated for each row or column will still include the values in the hidden rows or columns. Sometimes you may want your information to be in columns to be able to use the information in the best way. Select the data that you want to transpose, B2 through N10, copy the data, right click and select copy or use the keyboard shortcuts, select the cell where you want to paste the transposed data, right click and within "Paste special," click on "Paste transposed." If you're interested in showing what percentage a particular segment comprises of total business, consider using a pie chart. If you're interested in showing a trend, consider using a line chart. If you'd like to show the relationship between various points of data, consider using a scatter chart. If you're interested in identifying regional information, consider using a map.

### Video - [Pivot tables](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529057)

- [YouTube: Pivot tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mtfJgmi2zk)

Pivot Tables are another way to quickly summarize a large dataset in Google Sheets. They can be used to answer frequent or important questions like, did we achieve our third quarter sales goals? Or, how many chocolate croissants have we sold in South America over the last six months? These questions can often be answered by creating sometimes complex formulas in the sheet. However, a pivot table aggregates data in rows and columns into a summary table much more quickly than writing a custom formula. Using a pivot table, data can be reevaluated without modifying any formulas or having to recalculate a large dataset. It can quickly aggregate data to make thousands of cells of data simple to review and present. Let's take a look at pivot tables now.

### Video - [Create a pivot table](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529058)

- [YouTube: Create a pivot table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STT0R8jqdio)

person: Suppose Thomas Omar wants to know how the sales of On The Rise's products are doing in the South American market and what the forecast was for the last half of the year. He could use several sum formulas and filter the data, or he could set up a pivot table to provide him with the information quickly. To create a new pivot table, select a cell in a table of data. Open the Data menu and click "Pivot table." Choose the data range for the pivot table to reference by either typing the address or by clicking and dragging. Google Sheets will automatically populate the data range using AI. Choose the destination for the pivot table either in a new sheet or in an existing sheet. In our case, let's choose the range A1:H253 to capture the actual sales and forecast sales for the cities in South America. If "Existing sheet" is chosen, enter the sheet name and cell range address for it to appear in. Again, clicking and dragging a range is supported. Select M2 to add the pivot table on the existing sheet. The pivot table editor panel will appear on the right side of the sheet. Google Sheets AI will list suggested ways to summarize the data. Click the "preview pivot table" button to see what each suggestion will look like, and then click on the description to apply it to create the pivot table. In our case, Thomas Omar wants to see actual product sales by city. So we will need to choose the rows and columns necessary to complete the pivot table. Select "Add" for rows and choose "Product." The three products are added to the M column and information about those products will be added to the rows. You can sort this information in either ascending or descending order. Select "Add" for columns and choose "City." All of the cities in the South American region fill in across the columns in row three. We want to know the actual sales for each of these products in each of the cities. Select "Add" for values and choose "Sales - Actual," then summarize by sum. The sum of the products and grand total appears. You can also do this for the forecasted product sales by following the same steps, choosing "Sales - Forecast" instead of "Sales - Actual." Thomas Omar wants to know if a particular product is driving the sales in each city. To do that, he would like to see the percent of sales each product accounts for in the city. Let's create another pivot table. Select "Pivot table" from the Data menu. Choose the destination for the pivot table in the existing sheet in cell M18. Select "Add" for rows and choose "City." The cities are added to the M column, and the sales for each location will be added to the rows. The cities are sorted in alphabetical order by default. Select "Add" for columns and choose "Product." The three products fill in across the columns in row 19. We want to know the actual sales for each of these products in each of the cities. Select "Add" for values and choose "Sales - Actual," then summarize by sum. The sum of the products and grand total appears. However, we want to know the percent of the product sales by city. Click the down arrow under Show as and choose percentage of row.

Person: Google Docs and Google Slides both support Google Sheets charts. To add a chart in Docs or Slides, open the Insert menu, hover over Chart, and click "From Sheets." From the Insert Chart dialog, search for a spreadsheet or browse the thumbnails or list of spreadsheets in Google Drive. Click a spreadsheet and click "Select." View the previews of the charts in the spreadsheet, select one, and click "Import." By default, the inserted chart will remain linked to the spreadsheet, but you can uncheck that box to remove the link. Once the chart is inserted, the text wrap options and image options can be changed. Click the linked chart options button to either unlink the chart, open source to see the spreadsheet where the chart originated from, or view linked objects. Linked objects are displayed in a panel, and clicking them will open the spreadsheet in a new tab. Once the chart has been added, this menu will also contain an option to update, which populates the linked chart with the most recent data from the linked spreadsheet. A table can also be added to a Google Docs or Google Slides document from Google Sheets. Open the spreadsheet in Google Sheets. Select the cells in the table, Open the Edit menu, and click "Copy." Open a Google Docs or Google Slides document, click in the location to add the table in a document, open the Edit menu, and click "Paste." Choose to "Link to spreadsheet" or "Paste unlinked." click the "More Options" button in the upper right corner of the chart to edit, delete, download, publish, or copy the chart. You can also move the chart to its own sheet, and add alt text from the More options menu. To make the chart public, choose "Publish chart." It can be shared via a link, or embedded in a website. To create a link to the chart, click "Link" on the Publish to the web card. Choose to publish just the chart, a sheet, or the entire document. Choose to make it interactive, or just an image. A unique shareable link will be created and displayed. Under "Published content and settings," choose if only the chart, a sheet, or the entire document underlying the chart is also published. Click "Stop publishing" to turn off public access to the data. Click the Embed tab to create an embed code for adding a chart to a website. Again, choose to publish the chart, the sheet, or the entire document, and whether it will be interactive or an image. Google Sheets will generate custom embed HTML code. If you're comfortable, you can edit the code either prior to or after adding it to a website. To use the embed code, copy and paste it. Click "Stop publishing" to disable public access to the chart. With either option, choose to automatically republish when changes are made to ensure that the published chart is always displaying the most up-to-date data as the spreadsheet that underlies it. The Google Sheet can be made completely public by publishing it to the web on a website. Click "File," and then "Publish to the web" to choose your options for making the spreadsheet public. Sheets can also be published as a link, or embedded in a web page. Choose if your colleagues must be signed in to their Google Workspace account to view the spreadsheet, or if it can be viewed anonymously. You can also choose if you want the spreadsheet to be republished automatically after a content change.

### Video - [Macros](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293/video/529064)

- [YouTube: Macros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8FlW6zE9qE)

Macros in Google Sheets allow you to automate repetitive tasks. A macro is simply a series of steps that can be applied to a sheet and its contents with a click, saving time and ensuring accuracy. For example, specific formatting can be applied to a data set to highlight results by changing the header row text to bold, alternating colors for the rows, and making the sums of several columns display in red or green text, subject to conditional formatting rules. To create a new macro, open a spreadsheet. The sheet doesn't have to contain data. But the macro is specific to the spreadsheet, so data will have to be entered or copied to it before the macro that is created can be applied. Open the Extensions menu, hover over Macros, and click Record macro. The macro recording panel will open at the bottom of the sheet. Each action will now be saved to the macro for playback later. Before completing an action, choose between absolute and relative references. As you may remember from earlier in this course, absolute references mean that the actions recorded will be applied to the exact same cells every time the macro is run. Relative reference means that the macro actions will be applied to the selected data range when it is run. A macro that is created while a single cell is selected can be run against thousands of cells once it's recorded. When all of the actions have been completed, click Save to finish the recording and save the macro, type a descriptive name for the macro and optionally, give it a keyboard shortcut, or click Cancel to discard the macro. To use the macro, open the Extensions menu, hover over Macros, and select the macro from the list by clicking on its name. If this is the first time the macro has been used, an authorization prompt will appear, asking the user to allow the macro permission to interact with the spreadsheet and the data in it. Since the origin of the macro is clear, it's safe to allow it access. Macros in Google Sheets are created in a programming language specific to Google workspace called Google Apps Script. No knowledge of Google Apps Script is needed to create a macro. But when editing a macro, the code will be visible. If you need to change a macro's behavior, it's often simpler to just record a new macro, rather than attempt to edit the existing macro script. Let's take a look at how easy it is to create a macro now.

Person: Welcome to Module 4: Populate data using a Google Form. Google Forms are online surveys used to collect data and provide the opportunity for quick data analysis. Google Forms allow multiple question types, apply branching logic, as well as the options to embed YouTube videos and images. In this module, we're going to explore how forms and sheets work together by connecting collected form data to a spreadsheet, or by creating a form from an existing spreadsheet. To create a Google Form that connects a Google Sheets spreadsheet, open an existing spreadsheet, open the Tools menu, and click "Create a form." A Google Form will open in a new browser tab. The form will have the same name as the spreadsheet from where it was created, but it can be changed by clicking on the name and typing the new name. Google Forms supports many different question types. For text based answers, there are the short answer and paragraph question types. For choice based questions, there are multiple choice, dropdown, and checkbox question types. To accept a file as an answer, there is the file upload question type. For answers that are in a range, or for multiple answers to a single question, there are the linear scale, multiple choice grid, and checkbox grid question types. And lastly, there are the date and time question types. Every new form starts with a blank multiple choice question. To change the question type, click the dropdown and select another option. To add a new question to the form, click the "Add question" button from the floating toolbar to the left of the question card. To duplicate a question, click the "Duplicate" button on the question card. The question and any provided answers will be copied to a new question. To import questions from another Google Form in Google Drive, Click "Import questions" from the floating toolbar to the right of the question card, browse to the form that has the question or questions to import, and click "Select." Click "Select all" to import all of the questions in the form, or click the checkbox next to each question to import. Finally, click "Import questions" to add them to the form. If you want to customize the form for an event or an audience, you can change the theme and/or the font of the form. To change the theme, click the "Customize theme" button. The theme options panel will open on the right side of the page. To add a header image, click the "Choose image" button. Browse the headers provided by Google, upload an image from your device, or browse your Google Photos. Once an image has been selected, click "Insert" to add it to the form. The header will appear above the title of the form. Google Forms will automatically change the theme and background to complimentary colors based on the header image. Change the theme color by clicking on one of the options, or clicking the "Add custom color" button to choose a color visually or by hex number. Each theme has background color options to choose from. Click the background color to apply it. There are four font types to choose from: Basic, Decorative, Formal, and Playful. Click the dropdown to select a font other than Basic, which is the default font. To see the form as the respondents will see it, click the "Preview" button. This will open the form in a new browser tab.

Person: To access and change the form settings, click the "Settings" button. On the General tab, there are options for who can respond to the form, and what they can do when accessing it. Choose to collect email addresses, or have respondents remain anonymous. If email addresses are collected, respondents can also automatically get a copy of their responses via email. By default, forms created with a Google Workspace account will not allow respondents who are not members of the organization. Uncheck "restrict to users in your organization and its trusted organizations" to allow anyone to respond to the form. Responses can be limited to one per person, but this requires the respondents to log on to a Google account. Respondents can also be given the options to edit their response after submitting, and to see summary charts and text responses of other respondents. Only the owner and editors of the form can always view the results and transfer them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Editors can allow respondents to see the results if appropriate. On the presentation tab, a progress bar can be enabled, which can be helpful to respondents to know their progress in longer forms. Question order can be shuffled, which can be helpful to teachers using Google Forms for quizzes. By default, a link will be shown to submit another response unless "limit to one response" was selected on the General tab. A custom confirmation message can also be added. This will be displayed on the page after the respondent submits their answers. Forms also has a quiz mode, which can be enabled on the Quizzes tab. Click the slider to make this quiz to be able to assign point values and enable auto-grading. Grades can be released immediately after submission, or later after the answers are manually reviewed, which is required if some of the question types are paragraph or file upload. Lastly, the respondent can be given the ability to see missed questions, correct answers, and the point values for each question. To distribute the form to respondents. click the "Send" button to open the Send form dialog. Check the box to automatically collect respondents' email addresses. Then, choose how you wish to distribute the form. A number of sharing options are available. When distributing via email, type the respondents' email addresses in the "To" field, customize the subject if necessary, and add a custom message. Check "include form in email" to embed the form in the body of the message, which allows responses without having to open the form. Click "Send" to send the email. Click "Add collaborators" to share editing permissions with people. Editors will be able to view and delete form responses. Collaborators can only be editors. Click the link button to view the unique web link to the form. Copy the link and paste it in an email, other Google Docs, text message, et cetera, to share it. Click the "Shorten URL" checkbox to generate a much shorter forms.gle link to the form. Click the embed button to view the HTML code to add the form to a website. You can customize the width and height of the form in pixels before copying the code and pasting it on a page of a website.

person: Now it's time to put everything you've learned into practice. Before you get started, let's remind ourselves of the business challenge. On the Rise bakeries has recently started to use Google Sheets to compile and analyze their hiring data. Partner owner, Thomas Omar, has been so pleased with the increased visibility into the data, that he has asked the leadership team to use the same approach with the sales data. Thomas notes that he would like to have a visual representation of recent On the Rise sales, so he can easily see what is happening at a glance. He mentions a few new locations in Asia Pacific, which are of particular interest to him. He'd like to see how these stores are performing. The leadership team asks for your help. They would like you to create a Google Form so that the Asia Pacific stores can easily and securely share their sales data. The leadership team also asked for your help converting the data into two visual graphics, so that they can determine which stores might need some help. By using Google Forms and Google Sheets, the leadership team hopes to gain clarity so they can respond in a positive way and help the new stores grow. In the following activity, you will help Thomas Omar and the On the Rise team solve their business challenge using Google Sheets. Good luck.

Person: Congratulations on completing the course. We do hope that you have found it useful. Let's take a couple of moments to review what you've learned. We started by looking at some advanced formatting options. You can now apply and customize themes in Google Sheets. You can also apply conditional formatting to allow you to instantly visualize important information based upon cell content. You understand the differences between relative and absolute referencing, and how to build conditional statements using functions like if and ifs. You can also apply data validation to your spreadsheets to ensure data entry is accurate, and errors are reduced. You explored charts and pivot tables-- features in Google sheets that allow you to visualize large data sets instantly. You also learned how to automate repetitive tasks using macros. Then we looked at Google Forms, and you can now also use a Google Form to collect and collate data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for analysis. Finally, you took some of the learning from the course to help solve a particular business challenge being faced by our fictional Google Workspace customer, On the Rise. We hope that you enjoyed the course and are now confident using Google Sheets. As a cloud application, Google is adding new features all the time. So do continue to explore them as they are rolled out.
