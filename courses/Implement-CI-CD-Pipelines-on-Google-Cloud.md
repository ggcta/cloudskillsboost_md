# [Implement CI/CD Pipelines on Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/691)

**Description:**

Earn the intermediate skill badge by completing the Implement CI/CD Pipelines on Google Cloud course where you will learn how to use Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, and Cloud Deploy. You will interact with the Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Run, and GKE. This course will teach you how to build continuous integration pipelines, store and secure artifacts, scan for vulnerabilities, attest to the validity of approved releases. Additionally, you'll get hands-on experience deploying applications to both GKE and Cloud Run.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an skillbadge hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge, and the final assessment challenge lab, to receive a digital badge that you can share with your network.

## CI/CD on Google Cloud

### Lab - [Working with Artifact Registry](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/691/labs/500039)

Artifact Registry is a single place to manage container images and language packages, and is fully integrated with Google Cloud tooling and and runtimes. This makes it simple to integrate it with your CI/CD tooling to set up automated pipelines.

### Lab - [Google Kubernetes Engine Pipeline using Cloud Build](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/691/labs/500040)

Create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image, stores the image in Artifact Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine.

### Lab - [Continuous Delivery with Google Cloud Deploy](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/691/labs/500041)

Create a delivery pipeline using Google Cloud Deploy, create a release for a basic application, and promote the application through a series of Google Kubernetes Engine targets

### Lab - [Implement CI/CD Pipelines on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/691/labs/500042)

This lab will challenge you to create a CI/CD pipeline, deploy an application to GKE, and rollback that deployment.
