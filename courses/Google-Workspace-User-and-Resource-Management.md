Welcome to the Google Workspace User and Resource Management course. By enrolling in this course, you’ll be joining a community of new Google Workspace administrators who are helping transform the way their organizations work. Google Workspace is a suite of cloud-based productivity applications and services, like Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, that provide organizations with a whole new way to work together online. And it’s not just using email and chat, but over video conferences, social media, real-time document collaborations, and more. During this course, you’ll learn about the fundamental tools, features, and processes important to a Google Workspace administrator. Lessons include a mix of videos, hands-on exercises, and quizzes to help you evaluate what you’ve learned. At the end of the course, you’ll also find a resources section with links to additional reading material. When you begin the course, you’ll need to sign up for a trial Google Workspace account. Each Google Workspace account requires at least one registered internet domain. A domain name typically takes the form of your organization's name and a standard internet suffix. For example, if your organization is called mybusiness, you may choose the domain name mybusiness.com, with a website address of www.mybusiness.com and emails will be addressed to your users at username@mybusiness.com. You’ll purchase the domain as part of the signup flow, so you’ll own it. If you already own a domain, you can use that one, but please note that the instructions here assume you’re purchasing the domain as part of the signup process. Now it’s important to note that this course will not teach you how to associate an existing domain with Google Workspace. We have, however, provided links to the Google Workspace Admin Help Center, which does document the requirements and the process. The Workspace trial account is valid for 14 days, and no charges for Google Workspace are made to your credit card until that period has ended. If you’re planning to cancel your subscription when this training is complete, please do so before the trial period ends to avoid any charges. This is very important, so don't forget! Okay, let’s get started!

- [YouTube: Account domain and setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Zk1Fgyvp4)

In this section, you'll set up a domain, create a new Google Workspace account, sign in to the Admin console for the first time, and customize your company's profile. A Google Workspace account must be associated with a primary domain that is registered with a domain registrar, like Google Domains, GoDaddy, or Network Solutions, for example. During the Google Workspace setup, there is an option to purchase a domain or use an existing domain that you own. The exercise that follows takes you through purchasing a domain during sign up. This ensures that your domain ownership is verified immediately, and that your Domain Name System, or DNS, records are configured correctly for use with Google Workspace. Alternatively, there is an option to use an existing domain. The steps to configure an existing domain, however, vary by registrar, so we haven't included this process in an exercise. For assistance, please refer to the resources section that accompanies this course.

- [YouTube: Google Admin console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDBA6yB2Qo)

As an administrator, you manage all your Google Workspace services through the Google Admin console. You can use it to add or remove users, manage billing, set up mobile devices, and more. Let’s explore the console, and we’ll start by navigating to admin.google.com. After signing in, the console's Home page displays quick access to key areas like user management and billing. You’ll also find a “Discover” section with tips for configuring Workspace settings and optimizing collaboration, along with a Product updates section to help you stay informed on the latest features and improvements to Google Workspace. Now let’s navigate over to the main menu on the left. The Dashboard option provides relevant insights about your organization. Then there is the Directory menu, which includes a submenu. Let’s expand the list. Users is where you’ll go to add or manage users. Groups is where you’ll create groups and mailing lists. The target audiences page is where you manage target audiences, which are groups of people—like departments or teams—that you can recommend for users to share their items with. Organizational Units is where you set up a structure to apply settings and apps to groups or departments. Use the building and resources option to manage and monitor buildings, rooms, and resources. Directory settings lets you to control how users can access and change directory information And finally, Directory sync lets you synchronize user and group data from an external directory to your Google Cloud directory. Next up is the devices menu, which is where you can go to secure corporate data on devices. From the Apps menu, you can manage settings for Google Workspace apps and services, such as Gmail and Calendar. The Generative AI menu contains options for Gemini, Gemini for Workspace, and Gemini reports. Let’s explore each of these. The Gemini page is where you control how users interact with Gemini when they visit gemini.google.com or access Gemini in a mobile app. Gemini for Workspace is where you’ll go to manage how Gemini features are used in Workspace apps within your organization. And Gemini reports provides information on how Gemini is being used within your organization and at the individual user level. Next up is the Security menu, where you can manage security settings, like enforcing two-step verification and passwords, along with monitoring security and privacy issues affecting your domain. The Data menu is where you’ll go for an overview of compliance, data migration, and data export settings. Reporting lets you view reports and audit logs to examine any potential security risks and analyze user and administrator activity. The billing section is where you can add payment methods, view invoices, manage your subscriptions, and assign licenses. Account settings let you customize your organization's details and set your communication preferences. It’s here that you can also review and accept various compliance agreements, like GDPR or HIPAA, for example. Navigate to the Rules page to create rules and alerts to secure your organization's data, files, and devices. Storage is your command center for monitoring, managing, and optimizing how storage is used across your organization. And finally, you can use the Send feedback button to provide feedback about your experience with the Google Admin console.

### Video - [Provisioning](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90/video/526509)

- [YouTube: Provisioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq241-SAPTw)

Before anyone can use Google Workspace in your organization, you need to first give them their own user account. This is called provisioning. And if your organization uses Gmail, this will also give each user an e-mail address. The trial Google Workspace account you're using for this course is free for up to 10 users. The goal for this part of the course is to learn how to provision users, groups, and resources in your Google Workspace domain. We'll explore what happens with the management of those provisioned users, groups, and resources in more detail later on in this course. It's important to know that as a Google Workspace administrator, you have control over user passwords. To avoid confusion or being locked out of an account, it's best to keep a consistent policy for password creation. For the exercises that follow, the default password for all new users is hellohello1, unless you choose the auto-generated temporary password option. If you choose your own new password, please be sure to remember it.

### Video - [Provision users](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90/video/526510)

- [YouTube: Provision users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdJeEcOIPLw)

To use Google Workspace applications and services, each member of your organization requires a user account. And each account must be associated with a license. There are four different ways to add or provision your users. First, you can add them one at a time. Second, you can add them in bulk by uploading a CSV, or comma-separated values file. Third, you can add them via the Admin SDK Directory API. And fourth, you can add them using a provisioning tool, like Google Cloud Directory Sync.

### Video - [Google Cloud Directory Sync](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90/video/526512)

- [YouTube: Google Cloud Directory Sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zComAhR8v94)

As you've seen, when creating Google Workspace Accounts, you have the option to create them manually, one by one, or from a bulk list. These methods are generally more applicable to smaller organizations where less frequent user maintenance is needed. Larger organizations, however, often require a more automated approach to account management. Thus, these customers may choose to use Google Cloud Directory Sync, or GCDS, to revision Google Workspace accounts directly from their existing directory. GCDS supports any lightweight directory access protocol, or LDAP, directory server, such as Microsoft Active Directory. In addition to account creation, GCDS ensures that users, groups, organizational units and shared contacts in Google Workspace stay synchronized with updates made to the local directory. It's important to note that GCDS never modifies local directory information. Updates are only made to the Google Cloud Directory to reflect local changes. Google Cloud Directory Sync is particularly helpful for organizations that have a preestablished directory. Using GCDS removes the need to separately manage the cloud directory because it performs one-way synchronization, ensuring that Google domain data always matches the local directory. So how does it work? GCDS is an application, a Windows or Linux package, that is installed in an organization's network. It includes Configuration Manager, a user interface that provides a step-by-step guide to configuring and running the synchronization process. With Configuration Manager, you can set up and test the connection to your Google Directory and local LDAP server. You'll configure the LDAP search criteria to determine which users, groups, or other data to synchronize. You'll also set up notifications and logging options and verify settings. You can even run a simulated synchronization to ensure that everything is set up correctly without committing any changes. GCDS uses search rules to determine what to include in the synch. In addition to search rules, exclusion rules can be applied. These rules, as the name suggests, excludes data from the sync. For example, you might specify a search rule to synchronize all e-mail addresses, and then use an exclusion rule to ignore any e-mail addresses that being with a certain string. The combination of both search and exclusion rules allows you to finally tune the synchronization to meet your organizational requirements. The sync process can be run manually from Configuration Manager, but GCDS can also be run from the command line using the "sync" command. The sync command allows you to automate the synchronization process so you can schedule GCDS to run using a Linux cron job or Windows Scheduled Event.

Creating Google Workspace accounts can be done manually, one by one, or through a bulk upload. These methods work well for smaller organizations with minimal user changes, but larger organizations often need a more efficient and automated approach to user provisioning. That's where Google's Directory Sync comes in. This cloud-based service synchronizes users and groups directly from a Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to Google Workspace, eliminating the need for manual account creation and updates. Directory Sync is a one-way synchronization service. It only updates Google Workspace based on your Microsoft Active Directory information, ensuring it remains the primary source of truth for your user data. So, how does Directory Sync work? Directory Sync is a fully cloud-based service, meaning there's no need to install or maintain any software on your local network. All you have to do is connect Directory Sync to your Active Directory environment and Google Workspace domain using secure authentication. Once connected, Directory Sync automatically synchronizes essential user attributes, such as name, email address, and group memberships. You can also customize the synchronization process by selecting specific organizational units to include or exclude from the sync. It is important to note that Directory Sync is a separate service from Google Cloud Directory Sync, often referred to as GCDS. GCDS is an on-premises tool that offers extensive customization for syncing users from various directories, while Directory Sync is a cloud-based service focused on basic user and group synchronization from Microsoft Active Directory.

### Video - [Organizational structures](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90/video/526515)

- [YouTube: Organizational structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFKcKQAZ1T4)

Initially, all your provisioned users, devices, and groups will be placed in a single organization. All the settings you make in the Admin console apply to this top-level organization and, therefore, to all users, devices, and groups in your Google Workspace account. However, having all of your users, devices, or groups in one single organization can be limiting, so you may want to create an organizational structure by adding organizational units, or OUs, to your Google Workspace account. With OUs, you can control which applications and services are available to your users, and even configure those services differently for various sets of users. You can create as many organizational units as you want, either at the same level or in a hierarchy. Each child OU inherits settings from its parent. Changing a setting at a higher level changes the setting for all child OUs, unless you have overridden inheritance for the child OU. Please note that an individual user or device can belong to only one OU. If you manage a large number of users, or sync your LDAP directory, you might want to create a configuration or access group for your users. Configuration groups customize service settings. For example, you can prevent entire departments from externally sharing Drive files using organizational units, while still allowing select individuals within those departments to share externally by placing them in a configuration group. And then there are access groups, which are used to customize service access. For example, you can use organizational units to block YouTube access for entire departments, while still allowing access to select individuals within those departments by placing them in an access group.

Earlier in the course you learned how to add new users to your Google Workspace organization. Ongoing user account management is a core function of the Google Workspace administrator, and something that you will do on a daily basis. In the exercises that follow you will learn how to undertake some common user management tasks in Google Workspace. This includes adding an e-mail alias for a user, resetting a users password, renaming a user, suspending a user, deleting a user and restoring a recently deleted user.

### Video - [User licenses](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90/video/526522)

- [YouTube: User licenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkrwbGDXbs)

Every Google Workspace user needs a license to use a service. There are two types of licenses: a site-based license and a user-based license. When you sign up for a service that has a site-based license, such as Android, every user in your organization gets a license, so you don't need to assign this type of license. User-based licenses such as a Google Workspace license may need to be assigned depending on your subscriptions, and this can be done manually or automatically. If you purchase just one subscription, such as Google Workspace Enterprise, all of your users will get this license automatically so you don't need to assign a license. If you have multiple user-based subscriptions, such as Google Workspace and Google Drive Storage, you must assign a license to each user. You must also assign a license if you have multiple subscriptions to the same service. So for example, you may have Google Workspace Business Plus and Google Workspace Enterprise licenses in your organization. License assignment can be applied to everyone in your organization at the organizational unit level or at the individual user level. It's also possible to configure automatic license assignment for your organization so you don't need to manually assign a license to each user. Finally, it's worth noting that a single user can have a license for more than one Google service.

With Google Workspace, your organization can use groups to easily communicate and collaborate across teams. As an administrator, you can use groups to configure features and services for specific sets of users without changing your organizational structure. Beyond general organization, groups also play a crucial role in your Google Workspace security. As an administrator, you can use security groups   to control access to sensitive information and resources. You can create a new group or update an existing group to a security group. Adding the Security label to a group makes it a security group. This action is permanent and adds security features, but doesn’t remove any other features of the original group. Administrators can create groups in the Admin console. These groups can be used for collaboration and communication, including mailing lists. The administrator may also create groups to facilitate the management of Google Workspace. For example, a Google Group can be used to enable a service for a group of users even if the service is disabled for everyone else. In addition to the Admin console, an organization can choose to enable Google Groups for Business. When this service is enabled, users can access the organization's groups using the Google Groups application at groups.google.com. And depending on the service permissions, users can also create and manage their own groups. In addition to using the Admin console and the Google Groups for Business service to create groups, admins can leverage the Directory API. Google Cloud Directory Sync can also be used to sync groups from any LDAP-compliant directory to Google Workspace.

When you signed up for your Google Workspace account, you associated it with a primary domain. In addition to your primary domain, you can add up to 20 domain aliases to the primary domain. You can also add an additional 599 secondary domains. So, what’s a domain alias? A domain alias gives each user in the primary domain an additional email address. For example, let's say you have the primary domain yourcompany.com and you also own yourcompany.co.uk. With Google Workspace, you can add yourcompany.co.uk as a domain alias. This then allows all of the yourcompany.com users to send and receive email from yourcompany.co.uk. There are no additional license costs for a domain alias because no new accounts are created. Okay, now what's a secondary domain? A secondary domain is a new domain that you purchase, into which you add new users, each of which requires a license. Secondary domains are useful for managing separate teams or businesses at different domains. Please note that you must verify ownership of any domain alias or secondary domain you want to add to your Google Workspace account, just as you did for your primary domain.

In addition to scheduling meetings in Google Calendar, Google Workspace users in your organization can also manage shared resources. The most common example of a shared resource is a meeting room, but other examples include projectors, company fleet cars, or any other resource people might schedule a time to use. It's recommended that you define your resources using a structured format that includes information about the resource location, capacity, or equipment. Structured resource naming will help your users choose the best resource for their needs, so it’s worth making an effort when adding your organization’s resources to Google Calendar. Setting up your resources involves three steps. First you’ll add your building information, then you’ll add any features of the resource, and finally you’ll add the resources themselves. So for example, you may set up a new meeting room in the New York office that offers video conferencing facilities and which is named room 7C. Buildings, features, and resources are created from the Admin console. They can also be uploaded in bulk via a CSV file or created using one of the resource methods available in the Admin SDK Directory API.
