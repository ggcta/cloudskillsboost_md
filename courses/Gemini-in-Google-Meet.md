Hello and welcome to Gemini in Google Meet, a course in the Gemini for Google Workspace series. This course introduces you to the specific Meet features included with Gemini. You learn how to create meeting backgrounds, enhance audio-visual quality, translate captions during a meeting, and take meeting notes with Gemini in Google Meet. Gemini in Meet uses generative AI to help you work more efficiently. Remember, generative AI tools, including Gemini, might suggest inaccurate or inappropriate information. Don’t rely on Gemini features as medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. It’s also important to remember that the Gemini feature suggestions don’t represent Google’s views, and should not be attributed to Google. If you have questions, contact your Google Workspace Administrator.

In this demo, you explore how to create a custom background using Gemini in Google Meet. You’ll also learn how to add a style to your image. Imagine you’re an IT consultant and a client has scheduled a last minute meeting to discuss their new project, but your office is a mess. You want to project a professional image and also want to create a strong connection with them from the start. They are headquartered in Brazil and you want to think about changing your background to something more thematic. Instead of searching the web for an image, you can save time by creating a generative AI meeting background. You can easily access Gemini in Google Meet by joining a video meeting on your desktop computer using your preferred method like a meeting link or calendar invite. For this lesson, visit meet.google.com in a desktop browser. To begin, join a Google Meet video conference. From the New meeting button, you’re presented with three options. You can create a meeting for later, start an instant meeting, or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. Select start an instant meeting. Second, generate a background After you join the meeting, access the Effects panel by clicking More options, and then selecting Apply visual effects. In the Backgrounds section, select Generate a background. In the sidebar is a text input for describing your idea for the image. This is where you enter your prompt. You can type "Brazilian flag." After you type your prompt, click Create samples. You might need to wait several seconds for Gemini to generate a response. Depending on your prompt, you will usually receive a few visual options. Select the image you want to use and notice how your meeting background changes to the new image. Alternatively, as a customer service manager, you might want to commemorate your team's success in boosting customer satisfaction. With Gemini in Meet, you can create a celebratory meeting background to uplift the team spirit and acknowledge their success. Regardless of the visual you’re trying to generate, it’s important to provide a descriptive prompt to help Gemini understand what you want. A descriptive prompt can include specifics such as the setting, materials, or color. In addition to the text input, you can also choose to add a style. This is another input that lets you choose the visual style of the outputs provided by Gemini. You can choose from styles including Photography, Sci-fi, Fantasy, and 3D animation. These styles are then applied to the generated visuals. Now, apply a style. You can use a prompt like, “A vibrant confetti explosion against a backdrop of a cityscape” to generate your desired image. Perhaps you don’t want your backgrounds to be so photorealistic, and prefer more of a graphical, cartoon look. To create a futuristic looking visual, click the dropdown next to “No style” and select Sci-fi. After selecting a style, choose Create other samples to generate new images in that style. After generating the new images, review the output. To change your background, select “Use this background.”

Gemini in Meet helps ensure that you can be seen and heard by your audience with features like “studio look” and translated captions. The studio look feature in Meet uses Google’s AI to help improve your video quality and fixes issues caused by low light or low quality webcams. You can get custom adjustments with one click, without the need for an expensive and complex audio-visual setup. When you first join a scheduled Google Meet video conference, you are added to a green room– a virtual space that lets you preview and adjust your audio, video, and environment before joining a meeting. You can access the option to turn on “studio look” while you’re still in the green room. In your preview tile, click More, then, click Apply visual effects. If you’ve already joined a meeting, navigate to the Meet controls, click More, then click Apply visual effects. When you’re in the Effects menu, click Appearance, and then select Studio look. Enhancing video quality helps set the stage for clear communication, ensuring that you are seen clearly. In addition to improving video quality, you can enhance your video conferences by using translated captions with Gemini in Meet. With real-time caption translation, you can break down language barriers, foster global collaboration and create a more inclusive environment. Suppose you are joining a meeting with Google Meet with mostly French coworkers. Although you speak French pretty well, you aren’t a native speaker and don’t want to constantly ask your coworkers to translate for you. You want to ensure that you can understand the full conversation. With translated captions, speakers can speak in their preferred language and you can still follow along. As you join the meeting, you can turn on French to English translated captions to help you understand and follow along with the conversation. In the Meet controls, select More options, then select Settings. Click Captions to open the list of options. Turn on Captions, and then select the language of the meeting. Next, turn on Translated captions and choose the language to translate into. Please note: The captions are only visible to you. Additionally, each attendee can choose their preferred language for captions.

Imagine you're in an important brainstorming session with several colleagues and you volunteered as the meeting scribe. Everyone is mentioning good ideas, but you're struggling to quickly type the meeting notes and capture everything that has been stated. Unfortunately, you’ve been so busy typing that you haven’t been able to add your own valuable ideas to the conversation. With “Take notes for me” in Google Meet you can automatically capture meeting notes and share them using Google Docs. When taking notes using Gemini in Meet, you’ll need to decide whether you want to create a new document or use an existing document for your meeting notes. Perhaps you have a document that’s been used in the past that you’d like to use for note taking during this call. Before the meeting, attach your existing notes as a Google Docs file to your Calendar invite. To start taking notes, you must first join a Meet video conference. After you’ve joined the meeting, click Take notes for me. Select the file, then click Start taking notes. After the meeting, Gemini will add the notes from the meeting to the beginning of your chosen file. If you don’t have an existing notes document that you’d like to add to, select Start taking notes to create a new file in the meeting organizer’s Drive. After the meeting, a summary of the ideas discussed and any action items mentioned will be added to the document. If you choose the option to create a new doc for meeting notes, be aware that it will be subject to your Domain’s Google Drive retention policies. “Take notes for me” does not follow Google Meet retention policies. During the meeting you can turn Take notes for me on or off if there’s content you don’t want recorded. However, whichever document you choose when you first turn it on will be the meeting notes document for the entire meeting. After you turn on this feature, let everyone know you use Gemini in Meet to take notes. Google Meet informs all meeting participants that notes are being taken and a blue pencil icon appears on all participants' screens. At this time, meetings must be conducted in spoken English for this feature to work.
