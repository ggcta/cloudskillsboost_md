# [Developing Applications with Cloud Run on Google Cloud: Fundamentals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/559)

**Description:**

This course introduces the Cloud Run serverless platform for running applications.

In this course, you learn about the fundamentals of Cloud Run, its resource model and the container lifecycle.

You learn about service identities, how to control access to services, and how to develop and test your

application locally before deploying it to Cloud Run. The course also teaches you how to integrate

with other services on Google Cloud so you can build full-featured applications.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the fundamentals of Cloud Run that include the resource model,  container lifecycle, and autoscaling.
- Develop and test applications locally before deploying to Cloud Run.
- Use service identity and IAM with Cloud Run.
- Integrate Cloud Run applications with Google Cloud services.

#### Quiz 2.

> [!important]
> **What are some characteristics of an IAM policy? Select three.**
>
> - [ ] An IAM policy is attached to a Google Cloud resource.
> - [ ] An IAM policy consists of at most one policy binding that binds a member to one or more roles.

#### Quiz 3.

> [!important]
> **Which statements about using environment variables with Cloud Run are correct? Select two.**
>
> - [ ] Environment variables set in the container with the ENV statement in a Dockerfile take precedence over variables with the same name set on a Cloud Run service or job.
