# [Automate Deployment and Manage Traffic on a Google Cloud Network](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/764)

**Description:**

Networking is a principle theme of cloud computing. It's the underlying structure of Google Cloud, and it's what connects all your resources and services to one another. This course will cover essential Google Cloud networking services and will give you hands-on practice with specialized tools for developing mature networks. From learning the ins-and-outs of VPCs, to creating enterprise-grade load balancers, Automate Deployment and Manage Traffic on a Google Cloud Network will give you the practical experience needed so you can start building robust networks right away.

## Automate Deployment and Manage Traffic on a Google Cloud Network

### Lab - [Automating the Deployment of Networks with Terraform](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/764/labs/510874)

In this lab, you create a Terraform configuration with a module to automate the deployment of a custom network with resources.
