Hello and welcome to the Gemini for Google Workspace series. This course introduces you to Gemini in Gmail, which lets you write and refine emails by using AI. You learn how to use Help me write, our new AI writing tool in Gmail, to create a message from scratch, or refine what you’ve already written. You then complete a hands-on activity acting as a sales representative for Cymbal Retail, writing an email to a potential customer by using Gemini. Features in Gemini in Gmail use generative AI to help you work more efficiently. Remember, generative AI tools including Gemini, may suggest inaccurate or inappropriate information. You shouldn’t rely on Gemini features as medical, legal, financial or other professional advice. It’s also important to remember that the Gemini feature suggestions don’t represent Google’s views, and should not be attributed to Google. You might find that some features aren’t available in your Google Workspace edition or other features might be restricted by administrative policies. If you have questions, contact your Google Workspace Administrator.

The prompt can include information that describes the new benefit, who it applies to, and when it will become available. If you’re in IT, consider asking Gemini to email employees highlighting the latest software updates that the IT team launched. Or maybe you’re in sales and you need help with drafting personalized emails. Ask Gemini to email a thank you note after a productive meeting. You can specify the topic of discussion and the tone you want to convey. Regardless of your role, it’s important to provide a descriptive prompt to help Gemini understand what you're looking for. To help Gemini to better understand your expectations, avoid using jargon or technical language. Also, you can provide examples of the type of content you're looking for. After you type your prompt, click Create. You might need to wait a few moments for Gemini to generate a response. If you like what’s suggested, you can insert it into your email message.
