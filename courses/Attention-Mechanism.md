# [Attention Mechanism](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/537)

**Description:**

This course will introduce you to the attention mechanism, a powerful technique that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of an input sequence. You will learn how attention works, and how it can be used to improve the performance of a variety of machine learning tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. This course is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the concept of attention and how it works
- Learn how attention mechanism is applied to machine translation

## Introduction

In this module you will learn how attention works, and how it can be used to improve the performance of a variety of machine learning tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

### Quiz - [Attention Mechanism: Quiz](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/537/quizzes/489221)

#### Quiz 1.

> [!important]
> **What is the advantage of using the attention mechanism over a traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder?**
>
> - [ ] The attention mechanism lets the decoder focus on specific parts of the input sequence, which can improve the accuracy of the translation.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism is more cost-effective than a traditional RNN encoder-decoder.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism requires less CPU threads than a traditional RNN encoder-decoder.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism is faster than a traditional RNN encoder-decoder.

#### Quiz 2.

> [!important]
> **What is the purpose of the attention weights?**
>
> - [ ] To calculate the context vector by averaging words embedding in the context.
> - [ ] To incrementally apply noise to the input data.
> - [ ] To assign weights to different parts of the input sequence, with the most important parts receiving the highest weights.
> - [ ] To generate the output word based on the input data alone.

#### Quiz 3.

> [!important]
> **What is the name of the machine learning technique that allows a neural network to focus on specific parts of an input sequence?**
>
> - [ ] Convolutional neural network (CNN)
> - [ ] Attention mechanism
> - [ ] Encoder-decoder
> - [ ] Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

#### Quiz 4.

> [!important]
> **What are the two main steps of the attention mechanism?**
>
> - [ ] Calculating the context vector and generating the output word
> - [ ] Calculating the attention weights and generating the output word
> - [ ] Calculating the attention weights and generating the context vector
> - [ ] Calculating the context vector and generating the attention weights

#### Quiz 5.

> [!important]
> **What is the name of the machine learning architecture that can be used to translate text from one language to another?**
>
> - [ ] Convolutional neural network (CNN)
> - [ ] Encoder-decoder
> - [ ] Neural network
> - [ ] Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

#### Quiz 6.

> [!important]
> **How does an attention model differ from a traditional model?**
>
> - [ ] The decoder does not use any additional information.
> - [ ] The traditional model uses the input embedding directly in the decoder to get more context.
> - [ ] Attention models pass a lot more information to the decoder.
> - [ ] The decoder only uses the final hidden state from the encoder.

#### Quiz 7.

> [!important]
> **What is the advantage of using the attention mechanism over a traditional sequence-to-sequence model?**
>
> - [ ] The attention mechanism lets the model learn only short term dependencies.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism reduces the computation time of prediction.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism lets the model focus on specific parts of the input sequence.
> - [ ] The attention mechanism lets the model formulate parallel outputs.
