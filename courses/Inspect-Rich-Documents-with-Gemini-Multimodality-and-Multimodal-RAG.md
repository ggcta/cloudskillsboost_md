**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: using multimodal prompts to extract information from text and visual data, generating a video description, and retrieving extra information beyond the video using multimodality with Gemini; building metadata of documents containing text and images, getting all relevant text chunks, and printing citations by using Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Gemini.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete this skill badge course and the final assessment challenge lab to receive a skill badge that you can share with your network.

**Objectives:**

* Use the Vertex AI Gemini API to generate information and text from text, images, and video prompts.
* Extract, store, and search metadata of documents containing both text and images.
* Apply multimodality and multimodal RAG with Gemini to a real-world marketing scenario.
