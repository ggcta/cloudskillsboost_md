Hello and welcome to Gemini in Google Sheets, a course in the Gemini for Google Workspace series. This course introduces you to the specific Google Sheets features included with Gemini. You learn how to use Gemini in Sheets to generate tables. You then complete a hands-on activity where you act as a sales representative for Cymbal Retail and create a project plan. Gemini in Sheets uses generative AI to help you work more efficiently. Remember, generative AI tools, including Gemini, might suggest inaccurate or inappropriate information. Don’t rely on Gemini features as medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. It’s also important to remember that the Gemini feature suggestions don’t represent Google’s views and should not be attributed to Google. You might find that some features aren’t available in your Google Workspace edition or other features might be restricted by administrative policies. If you have questions, contact your Google Workspace Administrator.

You can easily access Gemini in Google Sheets by visiting sheets.google.com in your browser. If you haven’t already, open a new blank spreadsheet. In this lesson, you will learn how to use the table generation feature to create templates. In the toolbar, select Help me organize. You can access the “Help me organize” feature from the toolbar or the Google Sheets menu. Choose Insert > Help me organize. A sidebar opens for creating a template with Gemini. In the sidebar, is a text input for describing your idea for the template. This is where you enter your prompt. Perhaps you work in human resources, or HR, and are creating a template to track job candidates’ preferences based on their initial interview with a recruiter. The prompt to generate this template can include the general request to track candidate responses and the type of topics you want to track. For example, “Recruiting tracker for candidates answering questions during interviews on their desired location, level (entry, mid, senior), and salary” Or perhaps you work in marketing and you want to create a template for forecasting budgets for your team. The prompt to generate this can start out generic to give you ideas. For example, “Budget forecasting for marketing. Include at least 15 rows.”. Gemini in Sheets is used for generating spreadsheets and tables. It does not currently handle formatting or generating formulas, text, or images. Gemini in Sheets is most helpful when you have a generic idea of the type of template you are interested in, but maybe haven’t thought through all the details yet. To get the best results from your prompt, provide instructions instead of questions. When you provide more details in your prompt, the result can be more specific to your use-case. For example, you can specify how many rows you want included in your template. After you type your prompt, click Create. You might need to wait several seconds for Gemini to generate a response. A preview of your result will display in your spreadsheet. Choose Insert to have the generated table inserted into your spreadsheet. When the data is inserted, you can begin making any edits to get your final desired results and start filling in the template to your needs. Note that if you try to insert the generated table into a spreadsheet with existing data, a pop-up will appear. It will ask if you prefer to overwrite the current data or to insert your template in a new sheet. Overwriting will delete existing data on your sheet. It is best practice to use Help me organize in a new blank spreadsheet and then copy the result over to existing spreadsheets. In the next lesson, we walk through creating and refining a prompt for your template.

In this demo, you explore improving your template prompts by providing additional details. You learn how to: Create a prompt. And refine a prompt to improve the result. First, create a template by using Gemini in Sheets Suppose you work in customer service and noticed a lot of customers are calling in about the same issue. They are all experiencing loading delays or complete freezes on different webpages on the company website. You want to track this information for the product team. Open Sheets and open a new blank spreadsheet, then select Help me organize. In the text input, type the prompt. In this case, you can choose: “Track how long customers are stuck on a webpage.” Click Create. You might need to wait several seconds for Gemini to generate a response. Now, refine the prompt You notice that the template tracks duration, but you also want to track whether the customer is still stuck on the webpage or if the new page eventually loaded. Before refining a prompt, remember that you will lose your current output if you input a new prompt. For this reason, it is best to consider whether the generated template meets your needs. If it completely misses what you are looking for, you can refine your prompt and generate a new template. If you like aspects of the template, click Insert to add the template to your spreadsheet. Then you have two choices. You can simply edit the spreadsheet yourself, or you can refine your prompt and generate a new template. To refine the prompt, open Help me organize again and enter your new prompt. Edit the prompt so that it provides more details on your desired template. The new prompt can be: “Track how long customers are stuck on a webpage and if they are still stuck.” Then, click Create. You can now see that there is another column that gives options for the status of the issue: Stuck or Not Stuck. Lastly, insert and edit your template After you are happy with the result, you can insert the template. A pop-up will appear. It will ask if you prefer to overwrite the current data or to insert your template in a new sheet. Overwriting will delete existing data on your sheet. Choose Overwrite data. After it is inserted in your spreadsheet, you can make additional edits. For example, you might want the user column to track customer emails instead of customer IDs. You also might want to add a column tracking the name of the support agent who helped the customer. All of these edits can be made as usual by using your Google Sheets tooling.
