# [Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645)

**Description:**

Complete the intermediate Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud skill badge to demonstrate skills in the following: creating and assigning roles with Identity and Access Management (IAM); creating and managing service accounts; enabling private connectivity across virtual private cloud (VPC) networks; restricting application access using Identity-Aware Proxy; managing keys and encrypted data using Cloud Key Management Service (KMS); and creating a private Kubernetes cluster.

A skill badge is an exclusive digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your proficiency with Google Cloud products and services and tests your ability to apply your knowledge in an interactive hands-on environment. Complete the skill badge course, and final assessment challenge lab, to receive a digital badge that you can share with your network.

## Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud

### Lab - [Cloud IAM: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489292)

Google Cloud IAM unifies access  control for Cloud Platform services into a single system to present a consistent set of operations. Watch the short video <A HREF="https://youtu.be/PqMGmRhKsnM">Manage Access Control with Google Cloud IAM</A>.

### Lab - [IAM Custom Roles](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489293)

Cloud IAM provides the right tools to manage resource permissions with minimum fuss and high automation. You do not directly grant users permissions. Instead, you grant them roles, which bundle one or more permissions. This allows you to map job functions within your company to groups and roles.

### Lab - [Service Accounts and Roles: Fundamentals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489294)

In this hands-on lab, you learn how to create and manage Service Accounts

### Lab - [VPC Network Peering](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489295)

Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network Peering allows private connectivity across two VPC networks regardless of whether or not they belong to the same project or the same organization.

### Lab - [Getting Started with Cloud KMS](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489297)

In this lab, you work with advanced features of Google Cloud Security and Privacy APIs, including setting up a secure Cloud Storage bucket, managing keys and encrypted data using Key Management Storage, and viewing Cloud Storage audit logs.

### Lab - [Setting up a Private Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/645/labs/489298)

Hands-on lab for creating a private cluster in the cloud environment. In a private cluster, nodes do not have public IP addresses, so your workloads run in an environment that is isolated from the Internet. Prerequisites: Experience with Kubernetes Clusters, and CIDR-range IP address.
