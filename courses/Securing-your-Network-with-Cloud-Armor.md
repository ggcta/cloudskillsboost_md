# [Securing your Network with Cloud Armor](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/785)

**Description:**

Learn to secure your deployments on Google Cloud, including: how to use Cloud Armor bot management to mitigate bot risk and control access from automated clients; use Cloud Armor denylists to restrict or allow access to your HTTP(S) load balancer at the edge of the Google Cloud; apply Cloud Armor security policies to restrict access to cache objects on Cloud CDN and Google Cloud Storage; and mitigate common vulnerabilities using Cloud Armor WAF rules.

## Securing your Network with Cloud Armor

### Lab - [Bot Management with Google Cloud Armor and reCAPTCHA](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/785/labs/408518)

Use Google Cloud Armor bot management to mitigate bot risk and to control access from automated clients
